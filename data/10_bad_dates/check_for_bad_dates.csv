The separation of 20 relevant polyphenols from grape pomace extracts (GPEs) was achieved in less than 12 min by using a Kinetex C-18 column (3.0 mm x 100 mm, 2.6 mu m) with a gradient system of ultrapure water (0.1% formic acid) and acetonitrile, a temperature of 35 degrees C and a flow rate of 0.8 mL min(-1). The maximum backpressure reached was 327 bar, meaning the developed method is adequate for standard HPLC instruments. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by the determination of PPs in GPEs of different red grape varieties. Cabernet Sauvignon GPE showed the highest content of studied PPs (9804.2 mu g g(-1) GPE) followed by Bonarda GPE (7302.0 mu g g(-1) GPE). Besides the methodological development for a high throughput routine quality control of GPEs, this is the first report of PPs content for Bonarda and Aspirant Bouchet GPE, so the results add knowledge for these grape varieties cultivated in Argentina.

Fruits, vegetables, and beverages are the main sources of phenolic compounds in the human diet. These compounds are directly related to sensory characteristics of foods such as flavor, astringency and color. Polyphenols are extensively metabolized both in tissues and by the colonic microbiota. Normally, the circulating polyphenols are glucuronidated and/or sulphated and no free aglycones are found in plasma. The presence of phenolic compounds in the diet is beneficial to health due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and vasodilating properties. The health effects of polyphenols depend on the amount consumed and their bioavailability. Moreover, polyphenols are able to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, or protozoans. Some dietary polyphenols may have significant effects on the colonic flora providing a type of prebiotic effect. The anti-nutrient properties of polyphenols are also discussed in this paper.

Its approach of administering autologous tumor antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DCs) has garnered hope for more effective and less toxic therapy for patients with malignant brain tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). DCVax-Brain composition and efficacy are not fully disclosed, although sponsors claim it is poised to critically test clinical DC vaccine efficacy in GBM patients. Objective: This review examines the efficacy of DC vaccine therapy in treating GBM patients. Review question: To determine if the approach of DC vaccination followed by DCVax-Brain shows ample clinical promise in GBM patients. Search strategy: All published reports of DC vaccination for GBM and press releases regarding DCVax-Brain findings were evaluated. Critical appraisal of reports and summary of outcomes: Published DC vaccine trials for high-grade glioma patients suggest favorable clinical outcomes not easily ascribed to non-treatment parameters. Evidence of possible selection bias exists in many reports, but efforts to account for this are evident in the most recent publications. Conclusion: DC vaccine trials provide evidence of low toxicity in GBM patients and effective induction of antitumor immunity in the latest publications correlate with clinical improvements.

Pulmonary complications remain the leading cause of death in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected individuals, who display systemic oxidative stress and glutathione deficiency that can be modeled in transgenic rats where HIV-1-related viral proteins decrease glutathione levels and cause epithelial barrier dysfunction within the alveolar space by as yet unknown mechanisms. We hypothesized that HIV-1-related proteins inhibit Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defenses and thereby disrupt the normally tight alveolar epithelial barrier. Nrf2 RNA silencing dampened Nrf2/ARE activity, decreased the expression of the tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-18, increased paracellular permeability of alveolar epithelial monolayers derived from wild-type rats, and therefore reproduced the effects of HIV-1 transgene expression on the epithelial barrier that we had previously described. In contrast, upregulating Nrf2 activity, either by plasmid-mediated overexpression or treatment with the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane, increased the expression of ARE-dependent antioxidants, including NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 and glutathione, improved the expression of tight junction proteins, and restored the ability to form tight barriers in alveolar epithelial cells from HIV-1 transgenic rats. Taken together, these new findings argue that HIV-1-related proteins downregulate Nrf2 expression and/or activity within the alveolar epithelium, which in turn impairs antioxidant defenses and barrier function, thereby rendering the lung susceptible to oxidative stress and injury. Furthermore, this study suggests that activating the Nrf2/ARE pathway with the dietary supplement sulforaphane could augment antioxidant defenses and lung health in HIV-1-infected individuals.",NA,NA,NA,"Koval, Michael/C-6366-2015","Koval, Michael/0000-0002-5422-5614",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1040-0605,,,NA,NA,AUG,2013,305,3,,,,,1267,1277,,10.1152/ajplung.00288.2012,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000322699500007,NA,818,J,"Malhotra, D; Thimmulappa, R; Vij, N; Navas-Acien, A; Sussan, T; Merali, S; Zhang, L; Kelsen, SG; Myers, A; Wise, R; Tuder, R; Biswal, S",NA,,NA,"Malhotra, D.; Thimmulappa, R.; Vij, N.; Navas-Acien, A.; Sussan, T.; Merali, S.; Zhang, L.; Kelsen, S.

However, Nrf2 also regulates the proteasome system that degrades damaged and misfolded proteins. Because accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes ER stress and ER stress-induced apoptosis, Nrf2 may potentially prevent ER stress-mediated apoptosis in COPD. Objectives: To determine whether Nrf2-regulated proteasome function affects ER stress-mediated apoptosis in COPD. Methods: We assessed the expression of Nrf2, Nrf2-dependent proteasomal subunits, proteasomal activity, markers of ER stress, and apoptosis in emphysematous lungs of mice exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) as well as peripheral lung tissues from normal control subjects and patients with COPD. Measurements and Main Results: Compared with wild-type mice, emphysematous lungs of CS-exposed Nrf2-deficient mice exhibited markedly lower proteasomal activity and elevated markers of ER stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, compared with normal control subjects, lungs of patients with mild and advanced COPD showed a marked decrease in the expression of Nrf2-regulated proteasomal subunits and total proteasomal activity. However, they were associated with greater levels of ER stress and apoptosis markers. In vitro studies have demonstrated that enhancing proteasomal activity in Beas2B cells either by sulforaphane, an activator of Nrf2, or overexpression of Nrf2-regulated proteasomal subunit PSMB6, significantly inhibited cigarette smoke condensate (CSC)-induced ER stress and cell death. Conclusions: Impaired Nrf2 signaling causes significant decline in proteasomal activity and heightens ER stress response in lungs of patients with COPD and CS-exposed mice. Accordingly, pharmacological approaches that augment Nrf2 activity may protect against COPD progression by both up-regulating antioxidant defenses and relieving ER stress.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1073-449X,1535-4970,,NA,NA,15-Dec,2009,180,12,,,,NA,1196,1207,,10.1164/rccm.200903-0324OC,NA,NA,Critical Care Medicine; Respiratory System,General & Internal Medicine; Respiratory System,NA,WOS:000272889200007,19797762,674,1,"Heightened Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in the Lungs of Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: The Role of Nrf2-Regulated Proteasomal Activity (Retraction of vol 180, pg 1196, 2009)",1,heightened endoplasmic reticulum stress in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the role of nrf2-regulated proteasomal activity,heightened endoplasmic reticulum stress in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the role of nrf2-regulated proteasomal activity,FALSE,01-Aug-13,01-Feb-16,01-Oct-09,2013,2016,2009

It has been proposed that ABCG5/ABCG8 heterodimers mediate secretion of plant sterols and cholesterol by hepatocytes into bile and their efflux from enterocytes into the intestinal lumen. Methods: To test whether deficiency of ABCG5 alone Is sufficient to induce sitosterolemia, Abcg5-null mice were generated and characterized with respect to sterol metabolism. Results: Abcg5 deficiency was associated with strongly elevated plasma levels of beta-sitosterol (37-fold) and campesterol (7.7-fold) as well as reduced plasma cholesterol concentrations (-40%). Retention of orally administered [(3)H]beta-sitosterol in the intestinal wall (+550%) and plasma (+640%) was higher in Abcg5-null mice than in wild-type controls. Surprisingly, high plasma P-sitosterol and campesterol concentrations were even further elevated in Abcg5-null mice on treatment with the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 (0.015% dietary supplementation, 10 days), whereas these concentrations were reduced by similar to75% in wildtype mice. Both cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations in gallbladder bile were decreased, but, unexpectedly, cholesterol/phospholipid ratios were unchanged in the absence of Abcg5 and increased in both genotypes on LXR activation. Hepatic expression of Abcg8 was reduced by about 35% in Abcg5-deficient mice when compared with controls. No compensatory overexpression of other ABC transporters potentially involved in hepatic cholesterol trafficking was observed on messenger RNA level. Conclusions: Our data show that disruption of the Abcg5 gene alone is sufficient to cause hyperabsorption of dietary plant sterols and sitosterolemia in mice, whereas the ability to secrete cholesterol into bile is maintained.",NA,NA,NA,"Bloks, Vincent/A-7609-2012","Bloks, Vincent/0000-0001-6493-7482",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0016-5085,,,NA,NA,JAN,2004,126,1,,,,NA,290,300,,10.1053/j.gastro.2003.10.074,NA,NA,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,NA,WOS:000187803300032,14699507,481,1,"Sitosterolemia in ABC-transporter G5-deficient mice is aggravated on activation of the liver-X receptor (Retraction of vol 126, pg 290, 2004)",0,sitosterolemia in abc-transporter g5-deficient mice is aggravated on activation of the liver-x receptor,sitosterolemia in abc-transporter g5-deficient mice is aggravated on activation of the liver-x receptor,TRUE,2010 (book),Mar-04,Jan-04,2010,2004,2004

Because of high costs of LPE synthesis from hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamide (PE), costs for UDCA-LPE synthesis for in vivo and human use can become quite high. In this study, we evaluated whether ursodeoxycholyl phosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-PE), which is more cost-effective, could replace UDCA-LPE in terms of protection from hepatocellular injury. Materials and methods Anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties of UDCA-PE and UDCA-LPE were compared in TNFa/cyclohexamide (CHX)-treated HepG2 cells as well as in a mouse model of d-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide (Gal/LPS)-induced acute liver injury. Results Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide inhibited TNFa/CHX-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner and markedly ameliorated Gal/LPS-mediated fulminant hepatitis in mice. In contrast, UDCA-PE showed weaker hepatoprotective functions at low concentrations, and protection was lost at higher dosage. Analysis of hepatic gene expression showed that both conjugates significantly reduced Gal/LPS-mediated expression of chemoattractants, such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1) and RANTES. These inhibitory effects by UDCA-PE were transient while those by UDCA-LPE were sustained in attenuating expression of inflammatory MCP1 and RANTES expression. Conclusions Our data underline the superiority of UDCA-LPE compared to UDCA-PE in ameliorating acute liver inflammation.

Treatment failure in this group of patients is associated with continued airway inflammation and dampening of the inflammatory cascade is the focus of much research in this area. Continued airway inflammation has been associated with higher patient morbidity and is being increasingly measured using markers of systemic and local inflammation in order to target therapy more effectively. This review focuses on the published evidence for both established and novel treatments in refractory asthma that act to control this pathological inflammatory process. No clear treatment yet exists to control this process and further research into inhibiting newly elucidated inflammatory pathways of new drugs More effectively of accurate targeting existing pathways are discussed along with the clinical evidence and the relative merits of each treatment.

Methods and Objectives: We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design study in 38 patients with moderate asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroids but symptomatic during a run-in phase. Infliximab (5 mg/kg) or placebo was administered by intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. We assessed clinical response by monitoring lung function, symptoms, and inhaled beta(2)-agonist usage using hand-held electronic devices. Results: The primary endpoint, change in morning PEF at Days 50-56 compared with the last 7 d of the run-in, was not significantly different on treatment. However, infliximab was associated with a decrease in mean diurnal variation of PEF at Week 8 (p = 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], -8.1 to -0.72). Furthermore, there was a decrease in the number of patients with exacerbations of asthma (p = 0.01; 95% CI, 4.4 to 52.7) and an increased probability of freedom from exacerbation with time (p = 0.03) in patients on infliximab (n = 14) compared with placebo (n = 18). In addition, infliximab decreased levels of TNF-alpha (p = 0.01) and other cytokines in sputum supernatants. There were no serious adverse events related to the study agent. Conclusions: Treatment with infliximab was well tolerated and caused a decrease in the number of patients with exacerbations in symptomatic moderate asthma.

Our panel consisted of urologists and researchers from Europe, Asia, and the United States who reviewed original articles, reviews, and book chapters on individual bladder tumor markers published in the English language mainly using the PubMed search engine. Panel members also met during 3 international meetings to write recommendations regarding bladder tumor markers. The panel found that the most practical use of noninvasive tests is to monitor bladder cancer recurrence, thereby reducing the number of surveillance cystoscopies performed each year. Markers also may be useful in the screening of high-risk individuals for early detection of bladder cancer. However, more prospective studies are needed to strengthen this argument. Case-control and cohort studies show that several markers have a higher sensitivity to detect bladder cancer. However, cytology is the superior marker in terms of specificity, although some markers in limited numbers of studies have shown specificity equivalent to that of cytology. Our panel believes that several bladder tumor markers are more accurate in detecting bladder cancer than prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is in detecting prostate cancer.

One of our previously identified bladder cancer-specific proteins, BLCA-4, appears to be associated with a ""field effect"" of the disease, and in clinical trials is able to separate individuals with bladder cancer from those without the disease with high sensitivity and specificity. The potential clinical utility of this marker has led to the analysis of its function in bladder cancer pathobiology. Experimental Design: To additionally analyze the specificity of this marker, the expression in the urine of a variety of benign urologic conditions was analyzed. After cloning the gene encoding BLCA-4, functional aspects of the protein were analyzed by overexpressing it in cell systems, as well as its interaction with other transcription factors and in gel mobility shift assays. Finally, to determine the timing of expression in relation to the observance of bladder cancer, an animal model of the disease was examined. Results: Expression of BLCA-4, the cDNA of which reveals that it is a novel member of the ETS transcription factor family, is not found in benign urologic conditions. Overexpression leads to increased growth rates of cells, and the protein interacts with other transcription factors. In vivo studies reveal that BLCA-4 expression occurs significantly before the observance of grossly visible tumors in an animal model of the disease. Conclusions: BLCA-4 is a bladder cancer marker that is highly specific and occurs early in the development of the disease. It appears to be a transcription factor that may play a role in the regulation of the gene expression in bladder cancer.

Variability in WM ability is strongly correlated with IQ [1], and WM function is impaired in many neurological and psychiatric disorders [2, 3], suggesting that this system is a core component of higher cognition. WM storage is thought to be mediated by patterns of activity in neural populations selective for specific properties (e.g., color, orientation, location, and motion direction) of memoranda [4-13]. Accordingly, many models propose that differences in the amplitude of these population responses should be related to differences in memory performance [14, 15]. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and an image reconstruction technique based on a spatial encoding model [16] to visualize and quantify population-level memory representations supported by multivoxel patterns of activation within regions of occipital, parietal and frontal cortex while participants precisely remembered the location(s) of zero, one, or two small stimuli. We successfully reconstructed images containing representations of the remembered but not forgotten locations within regions of occipital, parietal, and frontal cortex using delay-period activation patterns.

The Semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) gene is involved in the migration of enteric neural precursors (ENPs). To analyze the function of SEMA3A in HSCR, the SEMA3A expression in different colon segments in HSCR was examined. METHODS: The expression levels of SEMA3A in both ganglionic and aganglionic colon tissues of 32 patients with HSCR and in colon tissue of 5 newborn unaffected individuals were examined by real-time RT-PCR, Western-blot, and immunohistology. RESULTS: Comparison of SEMA3A expression levels between ganglionic and aganglionic tissues in HSCR revealed upregulation of SEMA3A expression in 43.75% (14/32) of the aganglionic colons. SEMA3A was expressed in the ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus, submucosa, as well as in the longitudinal and circular muscle layer of the normal colon of both unaffected newborns and patients with HSCR. In the aganglionic segment of patients with HSCR, SEMA3A was highly expressed in the circular muscle layer and was also detected in the submucosa and in the longitudinal muscles layer. The fluorescence intensity of SEMA3A in the circular muscle layer in the aganglionic segment was much higher than that in ganglionic segment (p < .001). CONCLUSION: SEMA3A expression was upregulated in the aganglionic smooth muscle layer of the colon in some patients with HSCR and our data suggest that increased SEMA3A expression may be a risk factor for HSCR pathology in a subset of patients.

Decreased levels of RET expression may lead to the manifestation of HSCR. We previously showed that RET transcription was decreased due to alteration of the NKX2-1 binding site by two HSCR-associated RET promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This prompted us to investigate whether DNA alterations in NKX2-1 could play a role in HSCR by affecting the RET-regulatory properties of the NKX2-1 protein. Our initial study on 86 Chinese HSCR patients revealed a Gly322Ser amino acid substitution in the NKX2-1 protein. In this study, we have examined 102 additional Chinese and 70 Caucasian patients and 194 Chinese and 60 Caucasian unselected, unrelated, subjects as controls. The relevance of the DNA changes detected in NKX2-1 by direct sequencing were evaluated using bioinformatics, reporter and binding-assays, mouse neurosphere culture, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence techniques. Met3Leu and Pro48Pro were identified in 2 Caucasian and 1 Chinese patients respectively. In vitro analysis showed that Met3Leu reduced the activity of the RET promoter by 100% in the presence of the wild-type or HSCR-associated RET promoter SNP alleles. The apparent binding affinity of the NKX2-1 mutated protein was not decreased. The Met3Leu mutation may affect the interaction of NKX2-1 with its protein partners. The absence of NKX2-1 expression in mouse but not in human gut suggests that the role of NKX2-1 in gut development differs between the two species.

Newer forms of endocrine therapy now available for the management of endocrine responsive breast cancer include a new generation of aromatase inhibitors, which lower the estrogen ligand for ER, and pure ER antagonists which destroy the receptor. Despite these recent clinical advances, intrinsic and acquired resistance to these endocrine therapies is still a common feature that limits the success of this therapeutic strategy. Recent research into the molecular biology of ER signaling has revealed a remarkably complex interactive signaling with other growth factor signaling pathways in breast cancer cells, potentially explaining some of the reasons behind endocrine therapy action as well as resistance. This view of a more complex ER signaling system has uncovered new molecular targets which, if present in a cancer cell, might be additionally targeted using various signal transduction inhibitors to overcome or prevent resistance to endocrine therapy. In addition, the dynamic inverse relationship between the expression of ER and growth factor receptors brings more excitement to the potential of restoring ER expression in apparently ER-negative cells by inhibition of growth factor signaling.

In this Perspective, we present our group's recent work on bottom-up molecular control of nanoscale composition and morphology, low-temperature photochemical routes to semiconductor heterostructures and metastable phases, solar-to-chemical energy conversion with semiconductor-based photocatalysts, and controlled surface modification of colloidal semiconductors that bypasses ligand exchange.",NA,NA,NA,"Vela, Javier/I-4724-2014","Vela, Javier/0000-0001-5124-6893",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1948-7185,,,NA,NA,21-Feb,2013,4,4,,,,,653,668,,10.1021/jz302100r,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000315432000018,26281882,274,J,"Wang, XY; Ren, XF; Kahen, K; Hahn, MA; Rajeswaran, M; Maccagnano-Zacher, S; Silcox, J; Cragg, GE; Efros, AL; Krauss, TD",NA,,NA,"Wang, Xiaoyong; Ren, Xiaofan; Kahen, Keith; Hahn, Megan A.; Rajeswaran, Manju; Maccagnano-Zacher, Sara; Silcox, John; Cragg, George E.; Efros, Alexander L.; Krauss, Todd D.",NA,,"Non-blinking semiconductor nanocrystals (Retraction of vol 459, pg 686, 2009)",NATURE,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-0836,1476-4687,,NA,NA,26-Nov,2015,527,7579,,NA,,NA,,,,10.1038/nature15745,,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000365352500056,NA,NA,2009,"Wang, XY"," Ren, XF"," Kahen, K"," Hahn, MA"," Rajeswaran, M"," Maccagnano-Zacher, S"," Silcox, J"," Cragg, GE"," Efros, AL"," Krauss, TD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Wang, XY; Ren, XF; Kahen, K; Hahn, MA; Rajeswaran, M; Maccagnano-Zacher, S; Silcox, J; Cragg, GE; Efros, AL; Krauss, TD",NA,,NA,"Wang, Xiaoyong; Ren, Xiaofan; Kahen, Keith; Hahn, Megan A.; Rajeswaran, Manju; Maccagnano-Zacher, Sara; Silcox, John; Cragg, George E.; Efros, Alexander L.; Krauss, Todd D.",NA,,"Non-blinking semiconductor nanocrystals (Retracted article.

For semiconductor nanocrystals, it was originally proposed(3) that these 'off' periods corresponded to a nanocrystal with an extra charge. A charged nanocrystal could have its photoluminescence temporarily quenched owing to the high efficiency of non-radiative ( for example, Auger) recombination processes between the extra charge and a subsequently excited electron-hole pair; photoluminescence would resume only after the nanocrystal becomes neutralized again. Despite over a decade of research, completely non-blinking nanocrystals(4,5) have not been synthesized and an understanding of the blinking phenomenon(6) remains elusive. Here we report ternary core/shell CdZnSe/ZnSe semiconductor nanocrystals that individually exhibit continuous, non-blinking photoluminescence. Unexpectedly, these nanocrystals strongly photoluminesce despite being charged, as indicated by a multi-peaked photoluminescence spectral shape and short lifetime. To model the unusual photoluminescence properties of the CdZnSe/ZnSe nanocrystals, we softened the abrupt confinement potential of a typical core/shell nanocrystal, suggesting that the structure is a radially graded alloy of CdZnSe into ZnSe. As photoluminescence blinking severely limits the usefulness of nanocrystals in applications requiring a continuous output of single photons, these non-blinking nanocrystals may enable substantial advances in fields ranging from single-molecule biological labelling(7) to low-threshold lasers(8).",NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Xiaoyong/D-5956-2012; Wang, Xiaoyong/F-9542-2012",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-0836,1476-4687,,NA,NA,04-Jun,2009,459,7247,,,,NA,686,689,,10.1038/nature08072,NA,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000266608600040,19430463,239,1,"Non-blinking semiconductor nanocrystals (Retraction of vol 459, pg 686, 2009)",1,non-blinking semiconductor nanocrystals,non-blinking semiconductor nanocrystals,TRUE,21-Feb-13,26-Nov-15,04-Jun-09,2013,2015,2009

Seizures play a very important role in the quality of life, particularly in patients with slow-growing primary brain tumors. Tumor-related seizures are often refractory to antiepileptic treatment. Despite the importance of this subject to the fields of neurology, neurosurgery and neurooncology, the pathogenesis of tumor-related epilepsy remains poorly understood. This review summarizes possible mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of tumor-related epilepsy, including both tumoral and peri-tumoral aspects. Tumor cells themselves may create intrinsic epileptogenicity, and inadequate homeostasis in the peri-tumoral tissues may lead to seizure susceptibility. Other local changes in electrolytes, perfusion, metabolism, and enzymes could also contribute. It is generally accepted that changes in amino acid neurotransmission are the most important mechanism underlying tumor-related seizures, and changes in extracellular ions also play an important role. Hypoxia, acidosis, and metabolic, immunological, and inflammatory changes may also be involved in the occurrence of seizures. Knowledge of these mechanisms may provide guidance in the search for new strategies for the surgical and medical treatment of tumor-related epilepsy. (C) 2012 British Epilepsy Association.

An involvement of changed distribution and function of N-methyl-D-aspartate subclass of glutamate receptors also has been suggested. The often unpredictable responses to seizures after surgical tumor removal add substantial evidence that multiple factors are involved. The therapy Of tumor-related seizures is far from perfect. Several factors contribute to these treatment difficulties, such as tumor growth and drug interactions; however, one of the main reasons for poor seizure control may result from the insufficient or even absent influence of the currently available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on most of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of tumor-related seizures.

Over interpretation of nonsignificant or marginal probability values in large trials with overlapping end points, exclusion of patients not tolerating or not adhering to experimental treatments, labeling nonsignificant treatment effects as modest, and insufficient information on the quality of the BP measurements or on the BP changes early after randomization raise concern. From a clinical viewpoint, results should not be extrapolated to patients with characteristics dissimilar from those randomized. The benefit beyond BP lowering in cardiovascular prevention is tiny. Dual inhibition of the renin system should only be used in patients at high risk, in whom all drug combinations have been tried and who cannot be controlled by a single renin system inhibitor. Current evidence does not support BP lowering in normotensive patients or the use of renin system inhibitors for prevention of stroke recurrence. Because angiotensin-receptor blockers might offer less protection against myocardial infarction than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the latter should remain the preferred renin system inhibitor for cardiovascular prevention in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-tolerant patients. In 2 trials, in which new-onset diabetes was a predefined end point, 1000 patients had to be treated for 1 year with an angiotensin-receptor blocker instead of placebo to prevent just 2 cases. From a design viewpoint, the time has come to revise the concept of large simple trials and to pursue research questions that serve patient interests more than showing noninferiority or highlight the ancillary qualities of marketable antihypertensive drugs.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combined treatment of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin-II receptor blocker, and monotherapy of each drug at its maximum dose, in patients with non-diabetic renal disease. Methods 336 patients with non-diabetic renal disease were enrolled from one renal outpatient department in Japan. After screening and an 18-week run-in period, 263 patients were randomly assigned angiotensin-II receptor blocker (losartan, 100 mg daily), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril, 3 mg daily), or a combination of both drugs at equivalent doses. Survival analysis was done to compare the effects of each regimen on the combined primary endpoint of time to doubling of serum creatinine concentration or endstage renal disease. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings Seven patients discontinued or were otherwise lost to follow-up. Ten (11%) of 85 patients on combination treatment reached the combined primary endpoint compared with 20 (23%) of 85 on trandolapril alone (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% Cl 0.18-0.63, p=0.018) and 20 (23%) of 86 on losartan alone (0.40, 0.17-0.69, p=0.016).

Frequency of side-effects with combination treatment was the same as with trandolapril alone.

Although explicit molecular, histological and clinical characteristics have been reported for both subtypes, no specific therapy exists so far. However, the characterization of suitable molecular targets holds great promises to develop novel therapies in NSCLC. In the present study, global gene expression profiling of 58 human NSCLC specimens revealed large transcriptomic differences between AC and SCC subtypes: more than 1700 genes were found to be differentially expressed. The assignment of these genes to biological processes pointed to the deregulation of distinct sets of genes coding for cell junctions in both tumor subtypes. We focused on 17 cell adhesion genes and 11 reported marker genes for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and investigated their expression in matched tumor-normal specimens by quantitative real-time PCR. The majority of the cell adhesion genes was significantly up-regulated in at least one tumor subtype compared to normal tissue, predominantly desmosomes and gap junctions in SCC, and tight junctions in AC. The higher expression of EMT marker transcripts in tumor specimens suggested a large potential for invasion and migration processes in NSCLC. Our results indicate that AC and SCC in the lung are characterized by the expression of distinct sets of cell adhesion molecules which may represent promising targets for novel specific therapies.

This classification scheme is probably an imprecise predictor of the prognosis of an individual patient. Indeed, approximately 25 percent of patients with stage IA disease have a recurrence after surgery, suggesting the need to identify patients in this subgroup for more effective therapy. METHODS: We identified gene-expression profiles that predicted the risk of recurrence in a cohort of 89 patients with early-stage NSCLC (the lung metagene model). We evaluated the predictor in two independent groups of 25 patients from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0030 study and 84 patients from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9761 study. RESULTS: The lung metagene model predicted recurrence for individual patients significantly better than did clinical prognostic factors and was consistent across all early stages of NSCLC. Applied to the cohorts from the ACOSOG Z0030 trial and the CALGB 9761 trial, the lung metagene model had an overall predictive accuracy of 72 percent and 79 percent, respectively. The predictor also identified a subgroup of patients with stage IA disease who were at high risk for recurrence and who might be best treated by adjuvant chemotherapy.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a correlation between systemic inflammatory indexes and CS temperature and whether there is a difference in CS temperature between patients with single vs. multivessel disease. Materials and methods We included consecutive patients scheduled for coronary angiography for recent-onset chest pain evaluation. We measured C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the study population. Coronary sinus and RA blood temperature measurements were performed by a 7F thermography catheter. Delta T was calculated by subtracting the RA from the CS blood temperature. Results The study population comprised 53 patients with ACS, 25 patients with stable angina (SA) and 22 subjects without CAD (control group). Delta T was greater in patients with ACS and with SA compared with the control group (0.22 +/- 0.10 degrees C, 0.18 +/- 0.04 degrees C vs. 0.14 +/- 0.07 degrees C, P < 0.01 for both comparisons). The ACS group had greater Delta T compared with the SA group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.09). Eighteen (39.1%) out of 46 patients with multivessel disease had three-vessel disease and 28 (60.8%) had two-vessel disease.

Methods and Results-Seventy-two arteries were explored in 24 patients referred for percutaneous coronary intervention after a first ACS with troponin I elevation. Fifty plaque ruptures (mean, 2.08 per patient; range, 0 to 6) were diagnosed by the association of a ruptured capsule with intraplaque cavity. Plaque rupture on the culprit lesion was found in 9 patients (37.5%). At least 1 plaque rupture was found somewhere other than on the culprit lesion in 19 patients (79%).

In this study, we evaluated the role of DDR1 in DC maturation using human monocyte-derived DCs. Two DDRI isoforms, DDR1a and DDR1b, were expressed in both immature and mature DCs.

However, the plasma levels of IL-35 in patients with CAD have yet to be investigated. Methods: Plasma IL-35, IL-10, TGF-beta 1, IL-12 and IL-27 levels were measured using an ELISA in 43 stable angina pectoris (SAP) patients, 62 unstable angina pectoris (UAP) patients, 56 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients and 47 chest pain syndrome patients as a control group. Results: The results showed that plasma IL-35 levels were significantly decreased in the SAP group (90.74 +/- 34.22 pg/ml), the UAP group (72.20 +/- 26.63 pg/ml), and the AMI group (50.21 +/- 24.69 pg/ml) compared with chest pain syndrome group (115.06 +/- 32.27 pg/ml). Similar results were also demonstrated with IL-10 and TGF-beta 1.

In this study, we show that human T-reg express and require IL-35 for maximal suppressive capacity. Substantial upregulation of EBI3 and IL12A, but not IL10 and TGFB, was observed in activated human T-reg compared with conventional T cells (T-conv). Contact-independent T-reg-mediated suppression was IL-35 dependent and did not require IL-10 or TGF-beta. Lastly, human T-reg-mediated suppression led to the conversion of the suppressed T-conv into iTr35 cells, an IL-35-induced T-reg population, in an IL-35-dependent manner. Thus, IL-35 contributes to human T-reg-mediated suppression, and its conversion of suppressed target T-conv into IL-35-induced T-reg may contribute to infectious tolerance.

However, three-terminal devices, that is, transistors, could offer several advantages for logic operations compared to two-terminal switches, the most important of which is 'gain'-the ability to modulate the conductance.

Because broccoli contains high amounts of selenium and glucosinolates (particularly glucoraphanin and isothiocyanate sulforaphane), which can produce redox-regulated cardioprotective protein thioredoxin (Trx), it was reasoned that consumption of broccoli could be beneficial to the heart. To test this hypothesis, a group of rats were fed broccoli (slurry made with water) through gavaging; control animals were gavaged water only. After 30 days, the rats were sacrificed; isolated hearts perfused via working mode were made ischemic for 30 min followed by 2 h of reperfusion. The results demonstrated significant cardioprotection with broccoli as evidenced by improved postischemic ventricular function, reduced myocardial infarct size, and decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis accompanied by reduced cytochrome c release and increased pro-caspase 3 activities. Ischemia/reperfusion reduced both RNA transcripts and protein levels of the thioredoxin superfamily including Trx1, Trx2, glutaredoxin Grx1, Grx2, and peroxiredoxin (Prdx), which were either restored or enhanced with broccoli. Broccoli enhanced the expression of Nrf2, a cytosolic suppressor of Keapl, suggesting a role of antioxidant response element (ARE) in the induction of Trx. Additionally, broccoli induced the expression of another cardioprotective protein, heme oxygenase (HO)-1, which could be transactivated during the activation of Trx. Examination of the survival signal revealed that broccoli caused the phosphorylation of Akt and the induction of Bcl2 in concert with the activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor NF kappa B and Src kinase, indicating a role of Akt, Bcl2, and cSrc in the generation of survival signal. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that the consumption of broccoli triggers cardioprotection by generating a survival signal through the activation of several survival proteins and by redox cycling of thioredoxins.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0021-8561,,,NA,NA,23-Jan,2008,56,2,,,,NA,609,617,,10.1021/jf0728146,NA,NA,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Applied; Food Science & Technology",Agriculture; Chemistry; Food Science & Technology,NA,WOS:000252434800047,18163565,2149,1,"Broccoli: A Unique Vegetable That Protects Mammalian Hearts through the Redox Cycling of the Thioredoxin Superfamily (Retraction of vol 56, pg 609, 2008)",1,broccoli: a unique vegetable that protects mammalian hearts through the redox cycling of the thioredoxin superfamily,broccoli: a unique vegetable that protects mammalian hearts through the redox cycling of the thioredoxin superfamily,TRUE,unable to find,14-Mar-12,29-Dec-07,,2012,2007

Here, we show that the modulator of AAL cell death 1 (MACD1), which is an APETALA2/ET response factor (ERF) transcription factor, participates in ACD and acts downstream of ET signaling during ACD. MACD1 is a transcriptional activator and MACD1 overexpression plants showed earlier ACD induction than control plants, suggesting that MACD1 positively regulates factors affecting cell death. To investigate the role of MACD1 in PCD, we used Arabidopsis thaliana and a structural analog of AAL, fumonisin B1 (FB1). FB1-triggered cell death was compromised in ET signaling and erf102 mutants. The loh2 mutants showed sensitivity to AAL, and the loh2-1/erf102 double mutant compromised ACD, indicating that ERF102 also participates in ACD.

ERK activation was attenuated by inhibitors of the electron transport chain proton pumps (rotenone and antimycin A) and an uncoupler (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), suggesting that mitochondrial inner membrane potential plays a key role in the signaling pathway. ERK activation was also selectively attenuated by chain-breaking antioxidants and by vitamin E targeted to mitochondria, suggesting that transduction of the mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide signal is mediated by a lipid peroxidadon product.

We investigated, whether the in vitro paradigm of TLR2 dominance would hold true in vivo. Using an experimental peritonitis model, we challenged mice, with PGN or lipoteichoic acid and found that only PGN resulted in significant leukocyte (primarily neutrophil) accumulation in the peritoneum at 4 h. PGN-mediated leukocyte recruitment was P-/E-selectin dependent but only partially TLR2 dependent, and also involved the C5aR. Concomitant inhibition of TLR2 and C5aR resulted in. a further reduction in PGN-induced peritonitis. Peritoneal neutrophilia was partially mast cell dependent; however, the defect could not be reconstituted. With TLR2(-/-) or C5aR(-/-) mast cells. Interestingly, macrophage-deficient mice did not have defective neutrophil recruitment. By 24 h, the response to PGN involved primarily monocytes and was TLR2 and C5aR independent. Finally, we challenged mice with live S. aureus and found a similar degree of TLR2 involvement in leukocyte recruitment to that observed with PGN. Most importantly, bacterial clearance from the spleen and peritoneum was not altered in TLR2(-/-) mice vs wild-type mice. Morbidity was only significantly increased in S. aureus-infected mice treated with a blocking Fab against C5aR.

Recent studies have focused on the possibility of using human adult renal stem/progenitor cells (ARPCs) to improve the repair of AKI. Here we studied the influence of ARPCs on the healing of cisplatin-injured renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Tubular, but not glomerular, ARPCs provided a protective effect promoting proliferation of surviving tubular cells and inhibiting cisplatin-induced apoptosis. The recovery effect was specific to tubular ARPCs, occurred only after damage sensing, and was completely cancelled by TLR2 blockade on tubular ARPCs. Moreover, tubular, but not glomerular, ARPCs were resistant to the apoptotic effect of cisplatin. Tubular ARPCs operate mainly through the engagement of TLR2, the secretion of inhibin-A protein, and microvesicle-shuttled decorin, inhibin-A, and cyclin D1 mRNAs. These factors worked synergistically and were essential to the repair process. The involvement of tubular ARPC-secreted inhibin-A and decorin mRNA in the pathophysiology of AKI was also confirmed in transplant patients affected by delayed graft function. Hence, identification of this TLR2-driven recovery mechanism may shed light on new therapeutic strategies to promote the recovery capacity of the kidney in acute tubular damage.

Stimulation of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC), as well as MC/9 and P815 mast cell lines with millimolar concentrations of ATP, resulted in Ca2+ influx across the cellular membrane and cell permeabilization. Moreover, brief exposures to ATP were sufficient to induce apoptosis in BMMCs, MC/9, and P815 cells which involved activation of caspase-3 and -8. However, in the time period between commitment to apoptosis and actual cell death, ATP triggered rapid but transient phosphorylation of multiple signaling molecules in BMMCs and MC/9 cells, including ERK, Jak2, and STAT6. In addition, ATP stimulation enhanced the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, and TNF-alpha. The effects of ATP were mimicked by submillimolar concentrations of 3-O-(4'-benzoyl)-benzoyl-benzoyl-ATP, and were inhibited by pretreatment of mast cells with a selective blocker of human and mouse P2X(7) receptor, I[N,O-bis(5-isoquinolinesulphonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine, as well as oxidized ATP.

PREC were exposed to VEGF, IL-1 beta and PEDF at different concentrations, and in vitro permeability was assessed by solute flux assay using 70-kDa RITC-dextran. Angiogenic assays such as proliferation, migration and tube formation were determined by MTT, wound-scratch method and on-gel assay system respectively. To explore the signaling pathways behind VEGF-and IL-1 beta-induced PREC permeability, an inhibitor assay was carried out using PP2, a Src kinase inhibitor.

ICU physicians were audited concerning their use of static and dynamic haemodynamic parameters before each VE performed in patients with SIRS for 6 consecutive weeks. Results: The median volume of the 566 VEs administered to patients with SIRS was 1000 mL [5001000 mL]. Although at least one static or dynamic haemodynamic parameter was measurable before 99% (95% CI, 99%-100%) of VEs, at least one them was used in only 38% (95% CI, 34%-42%) of cases: static parameters in 11% of cases (95% CI, 10%-12%) and dynamic parameters in 32% (95% CI, 30%-34%). Static parameters were never used when uninterpretable. For 15% of VEs (95% CI, 12%-18%), a dynamic parameter was measured in the presence of contraindications. Among dynamic parameters, respiratory variations in arterial pulse pressure (PPV) and passive leg raising (PLR) were measurable and interpretable before 17% and 90% of VEs, respectively. Conclusions: Haemodynamic parameters are underused for predicting fluid responsiveness in current practice. In contrast to static parameters, dynamic parameters are often incorrectly used in the presence of contraindications. PLR is more frequently valid than PPV for predicting fluid responsiveness in ICU patients. (C) 2015 Societe francaise d'anesthesie et de reanimation (Sfar). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

During the past decade, there have been new understandings and developments in the diagnosis, etiology, and early and late management of the disease. As the diagnosis of AP is most often established by clinical symptoms and laboratory testing, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically. Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed. Patients with organ failure and/or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) should be admitted to an intensive care unit or intermediary care setting whenever possible. Aggressive hydration should be provided to all patients, unless cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidites preclude it. Early aggressive intravenous hydration is most beneficial within the first 12-24 h, and may have little benefit beyond. Patients with AP and concurrent acute cholangitis should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 24 h of admission. Pancreatic duct stents and/or postprocedure rectal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) suppositories should be utilized to lower the risk of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe AP and/or sterile necrosis is not recommended. In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis may be useful in delaying intervention, thus decreasing morbidity and mortality. In mild AP, oral feedings can be started immediately if there is no nausea and vomiting. In severe AP, enteral nutrition is recommended to prevent infectious complications, whereas parenteral nutrition should be avoided. Asymptomatic pancreatic and/or extrapancreatic necrosis and/or pseudocysts do not warrant intervention regardless of size, location, and/or extension. In stable patients with infected necrosis, surgical, radiologic, and/or endoscopic drainage should be delayed, preferably for 4 weeks, to allow the development of a wall around the necrosis.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0002-9270,1572-0241,,NA,NA,SEP,2013,108,9,,,,NA,1400,1415,,10.1038/ajg.2013.218,NA,NA,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,NA,WOS:000324708500004,23896955,66,1,"American College of Gastroenterology Guidelines: Management of Acute Pancreatitis (Retraction of vol 108, pg 1400, 2013)",1,american college of gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis,american college of gastroenterology guideline: management of acute pancreatitis,FALSE,Apr-16,05-Feb-14,30-Jul-13,2016,2014,2013

Biophysical methods used to examine various molecular interactions between solutes and protein molecules are discussed with an emphasis on applications to pharmaceutical excipients in terms of their effects on protein stability. Key mechanisms of protein-excipient interactions such as electrostatic and cation-pi interactions, preferential hydration, dispersive forces, and hydrogen bonding are presented in the context of different physical states of the formulation such as frozen liquids, solutions, gels, freeze-dried solids and interfacial phenomenon. An overview of the different classes of pharmaceutical excipients used to formulate and stabilize protein therapeutic drugs is also presented along with the rationale for use in different dosage forms including practical pharmaceutical considerations. The utility of high throughput analytical methodologies to examine protein-excipient interactions is presented in terms of expanding formulation design space and accelerating experimental timelines.

We measure the effect of solvent substitution on the rate of unfolding of the 127 titin module, placed under a constant stretching force. From the force dependency of the unfolding rate, we determine Delta x(u), the distance to the transition state. Unfolding the 127 protein in water gives a Delta x(u) = 2.5 angstrom, a distance that compares well to the size of a water molecule. Although the height of the activation energy barrier to unfolding is greatly increased in both glycerol and deuterium oxide solutions, Ox depends on the size of the solvent molecules. Upon replacement of water by increasing amounts of the larger glycerol molecules, Delta x(u) increases rapidly and plateaus at its maximum value of 4.4 angstrom. In contrast, replacement of water by the similarly sized deuterium oxide does not change the value of Ox. From these results we estimate that six to eight water molecules form part of the unfolding transition state structure of the 127 protein, and that the presence of just one glycerol molecule in the transition state is enough to lengthen Ox. Our results show that solvent composition is important for the mechanical function of proteins. Furthermore, given that solvent composition is actively regulated in vivo, it may represent an important modulatory pathway for the regulation of tissue elasticity and other important functions in cellular mechanics.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-8424,,,NA,NA,04-Mar,2008,105,9,,,,NA,3185,3190,,10.1073/pnas.0706075105,NA,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000253846500005,18305176,2218,1,"Solvent molecules bridge the mechanical unfolding transition state of a protein (Retraction of vol 105, pg 3185, 2008)",0,solvent molecules bridge the mechanical unfolding transition state of a protein,solvent molecules bridge the mechanical unfolding transition state of a protein,TRUE,Oct-11,20-Dec-11,04-Mar-08,2011,2011,2008

Overexpressing LPP-1 decreased the net specific cell association of LPA with Rats fibroblasts by approximately 50% at 37 degrees C when less than 10% of LPA was dephosphorylated. This attenuated cell activation as indicated by diminished responses, including cAMP, Ca2+, activation of phospholipase D and ERK, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Conversely, decreasing LPP-1 expression increased net LPA association, ERK stimulation, and DNA synthesis. Whereas changing LPP-1 expression did not alter the apparent K-d and B-max for LPA binding at 4 degrees C, increasing Ca2+ from 0 to 50 mu M increased the K-d from 40 to 900 nM. Decreasing extracellular Ca2+ from 1.8 mM to 10 mu M increased LPA binding by 20-fold, shifting the threshold for ERK activation to the nanomolar range. Hence the Ca2+ dependence of the apparent K-d values explains the long-standing discrepancy of why micromolar LPA is often needed to activate cells at physiological Ca2+ levels.

However, the spectrum of direct targets of hnRNP L activity in T cells has yet to be defined. In this study, we used cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) to identify the RNA binding sites of hnRNP L within the transcriptomes of human CD4(+) and cultured Jurkat T cells. We find that hnRNP L binds preferentially to transcripts encoding proteins involved in RNA processing and in Wnt and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. This binding is largely conserved across both quiescent and activated T cells, in agreement with the critical role of hnRNP L throughout T cell biology. Importantly, based on the binding profile of hnRNP L, we validate numerous instances of hnRNP L-dependent alternative splicing of genes critical to T cell function. We further show that alternative exons with weak 5' splice site sequences specifically show a strong correlation between hnRNP L binding and hnRNP L-dependent splicing regulation.

Barium follow-through radiography was done where possible. Biochemical, haematological, and immunological profiles were examined. Findings Onset of behavioural symptoms was associated, by the parents, with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination in eight of the 12 children, with measles infection in one child, and otitis media in another. All 12 children had intestinal abnormalities, ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration. Histology showed patchy chronic inflammation in the colon in 11 children and reactive ileal lymphoid hyperplasia in seven, but no granulomas. Behavioural disorders included autism (nine), disintegrative psychosis (one), and possible postviral or vaccinal encephalitis (two). There were no focal neurological abnormalities and MRI and EEG tests were normal. Abnormal laboratory results were significantly raised urinary methylmalonic acid compared with age-matched controls (p=0.003), low haemoglobin in four children, and a low serum IgA in four children.

The characterization of harpins in Xanthomonas species is largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that Xanthomonas produce a highly conserved single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSBX) that elicits HR in tobacco as by harpin Hpa1. SSBX, like Hpa1, is an acidic, glycine-rich, heat-stable protein that lacks cysteine residues. SSBX-triggered HR in tobacco, as by Hpa1, is characterized by the oxidative burst, the expression of HR markers (HIN1, HSR203J), pathogenesis-related genes, and callose deposition. Both SSBX-and Hpa1-induced HRs can be inhibited by general metabolism inhibitors actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and lanthanum chloride. Furthermore, those HRs activate the expression of BAK1 and BIK1 genes that are essential for induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and salicylic acid pathways. Once applied to plants, SSBX induces resistance to the fungal pathogen Alternaria alternata and enhances plant growth. When ssb(X) was deleted in X. oryzae pv. oryzicola, the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak in rice, the resulting ssb(Xoc) mutant was reduced in virulence and bacterial growth in planta, but retained its ability to trigger HR in tobacco. Interestingly, ssbXoc contains an imperfect PIP-box (plant-inducible promoter) and the expression of ssb(Xoc) is regulated by HrpX, which belongs to the AraC family of transcriptional activators. Immunoblotting evidence showed that SSBx secretion requires a functional type-III secretion system as Hpa1 does.

Using coimmunoprecipitation, we found that XA21 is required for axY(S)22 binding and recognition. axY(S)22 is 100% conserved in all analyzed Xanthomonas species, confirming that Ax21 is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and that XA21 is a pattern recognition receptor.",NA,NA,NA,"poinssot, benoit/B-2569-2009",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0036-8075,1095-9203,,NA,NA,06-Nov,2009,326,5954,,,,NA,850,853,,10.1126/science.1173438,NA,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000271468000043,19892983,67,1,"A type I-secreted, sulfated peptide triggers XA21-mediated innate immunity (Retraction of vol 326, pg 850, 2009)",1,"a type i-secreted, sulfated peptide triggers xa21-mediated innate immunity","a type i-secreted, sulfated peptide triggers xa21-mediated innate immunity",TRUE,13-Feb-13,11-Oct-13,06-Nov-09,2013,2013,2009

Subtype E has the ability to replicate in vitro in Langerhans cells. We hypothesized that this cell type might constitute a reservoir for the HIV virus in infected lymph nodes. We examined lymph nodes from 25 HIV-1 subtype E-infected patients to determine the immunophenotype of HIV-1-infected cells, their numbers and their distribution. The presence of HIV was detected either by in situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or immunoperoxidase. Cell identity was determined by double labelling using alkaline phosphatase-based immunohistochemistry. The majority of HIV-infected cells in the lymph nodes were Langerhans cells (CD1a+S100+) and Langerhans-related dendritic cells (p55+S100+). These cells were located in the paracortical areas of lymph nodes, with a few cells scattered at the edges of germinal centers, but were absent from germinal centers themselves, in contrast to the reported distribution of subtype B virus. In addition, multinucleated giant cells were significantly more common in HIV-infected nodes (64%) compared to controls (4%) ( P = 0.00002).

It is estimated that such stress conditions can potentially reduce the yield of crop plants by more than 50%. Investigations of the physiological, biochemical and molecular aspects of stress tolerance have been conducted to unravel the intrinsic mechanisms developed during evolution to mitigate against stress by plants. Before the advent of the genomics era, researchers primarily used a gene-by-gene approach to decipher the function of the genes involved in the abiotic stress response. However, abiotic stress tolerance is a complex trait and, although large numbers of genes have been identified to be involved in the abiotic stress response, there remain large gaps in our understanding of the trait. The availability of the genome sequences of certain important plant species has enabled the use of strategies, such as genome-wide expression profiling, to identify the genes associated with the stress response, followed by the verification of gene function by the analysis of mutants and transgenics. Certain components of both abscisic acid-dependent and -independent cascades involved in the stress response have already been identified.

Andrographolide (Andro), the major constituent of Andrographis paniculata (Burm. F.) Nees plant, is implicated towards its pharmacological activity. To investigate the mechanism basis for the anti-tumor properties of Andro, Andro was used to examine its effect on cell-cycle progression in human colorectal carcinoma Lovo cells. The data from cell growth experiment showed that Andro exhibited the anti-proliferation effect on Lovo cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This event was accompanied the arrest of the cells at the G1-S phase by Andro at the tested concentrations of 0-30 mu M. Cellular uptake of Andro and Andro was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis analysis and the intracellular accumulation of Andro (0.61 +/- 0.07 mu M/mg protein) was observed when treatment of Lovo cells with Andro for 12 h. In addition, an accumulation of the cells in G1 phase (15% increase for 10 mu M of Andro) was observed as well as by the association with a marked decrease in the protein expression of Cyclin A, Cyclin D1, Cdk2 and Cdk4. Andro also inducted the content of Cdk inhibitor p21 and p16, and the phosphorylation of p53. Further immunoprecipitation studies found that, in response to the treatment, the formation of Cyclin D1/Cdk4 and Cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes had declined, preventing the phosphorylation of Rb and the subsequent dissociation of Rb/E2F complex. These results suggested Andro can inhibit Lovo cell growth by G1-S phase arrest, and was exerted by inducing the expression of p53, p21 and p16 that, in turn, repressed the activity of Cyclin D1/Cdk4 and/or Cyclin A/Cdk2, as well as Rb phosphorylation.

We demonstrate in this report a dose- and time-dependent down-regulation of expression of cyclin E by curcumin that correlates with the decrease in the proliferation of human prostate and breast cancer cells. The suppression of cyclin E expression was not cell type dependent as down-regulation occurred in estrogen-positive and -negative breast cancer cells, androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells, leukemia and lymphoma cells, head and neck carcinoma cells, and lung cancer cells. Curcumin-induced down-regulation of cyclin E was reversed by proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and N-acetyl-L-leuCyl-L-leucyl-L-norleucinal, suggesting the role of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway. We found that curcumin enhanced the expression of tumor cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitofs p21 and p27 as well as tumor suppressor protein p53 but suppressed the expression of retinoblastoma protein. Curcumin also induced the accumulation of the cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Overall, our results suggest that proteasome-mediated down-regulation of cyclin E and up-regulation of CDK inhibitors may contribute to the antiproliferative effects of curcumin against various tumors.

The asymmetric distribution of charged residues lining a central chamber suggests a general mechanism for the translocation of substrate by MsbA and other MDR-ABC transporters. The structure of MsbA can serve as a model for the MDR-ABC transporters that confer multidrug resistance to cancer cells and infectious microorganisms.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0036-8075,,,NA,NA,07-Sep,2001,293,5536,,,,NA,1793,1800,,10.1126/science.293.5536.1793,NA,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000170894400037,11546864,2,0,"Structure of MsbA from E. coli: A homolog of the multidrug resistance ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters (Retraction of vol 293, pg 1793, 2001)",1,structure of msba from e. coli: a homolog of the multidrug resistance atp binding cassette transporters,structure of msba from e-coli: a homolog of the multidrug resistance atp binding cassette transporters,FALSE,19-Mar-02,22-Dec-06,07-Sep-01,2002,2006,2001

Soluble IL-15Ralpha (sIL-15Ralpha) can be detected in mouse sera and cell-conditioned media by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. This protein has a molecular mass of about 30 kDa because of the presence of a single N-glycosylation site, which is reduced to 26 kDa after N-glycosidase treatment. Transmembrane IL-15Ralpha is constitutively converted into its soluble form by proteolytic cleavage that involves tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme ( TACE), and this process is further enhanced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation. The hydroxamate GW280264X, which is capable of blocking TACE and the closely related disintegrin-like metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), effectively inhibited both spontaneous and PMA-inducible cleavage of IL-15Ralpha, whereas GI254023X, which preferentially blocks ADAM10, was ineffective. Overexpression of TACE but not ADAM10 in COS-7 cells enhanced the constitutive and PMA-inducible cleavage of IL-15Ralpha. Moreover, murine fibroblasts deficient in TACE but not ADAM10 expression exhibited a significant reduction in the spontaneous and inducible IL-15Ralpha shedding, whereas a reconstitution of TACE in these cells restored the release of sIL-15Ralpha, thereby suggesting that TACE-mediated proteolysis may represent a major mechanism for sIL-15Ralpha generation in mice.

The present experiments sought to determine whether cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3), suppressed elastase-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development in a rat model. Methods. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 16/each group) were randomly distributed into three groups: sham-, saline-, and cilostazol-. Rats of saline and cilostazol groups underwent intra-aortic elastase perfusion to induce AAAs, while rats of sham-group were perfused with saline. Rats of cilostazol-group received cilostazol treatment (100 mgkg(-1)d(-1)) for the entire experimental period. The areas of the lumen of the aortas at the segment with maximum diameter were measured preperfusion and on d 7, 14 after perfusion. Systolic blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff technique. Aortic tissue samples were harvested on d 14 after intra-aortic perfusion and evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot for matrix metalloproteinase-2, 9 (MMP-2, 9), by immunohistochemistry for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), and by Gomori aldehyde fuchsin for elastin. Activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these samples were also measured. Results. On d 14, rats of saline-group had significantly increased aortic sizes compared with sham-group (P < 0.01), while, cilostazol treatment significantly reduced this increase (cilostazol-versus saline-, P< 0.01) without affecting blood pressure (P > 0.05). The expression of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 and the destruction of elastic fibers in aortic tissues were significantly decreased by cilostazol treatment (P < 0.05), probably through the suppression of NF-kappa B-activation (P< 0.01). Consistently, cilostazol significantly inhibited NADPH oxidase activity (P < 0.01), accompanied by a reduced level of ROS (P< 0.01). Conclusion. Cilostazol retards experimental AAAs development independently of blood pressure reduction possibly by inhibiting proteolysis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Selective PDE3 inhibition may offer an additional method to pharmacologically inhibit AAAs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that cilostazol may prevent inflammatory cytokine induced-nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vascular endothelial cells. Cilostazol was observed to activate AMPK and its downstream target, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Phosphorylation of AMPK with cilostazol was not affected by co-treatment with an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, SQ 22536, and a cell-permeable cAMP analogue, pCTP-cAMP, did not induce AMPK phosphorylation and had no effect on cilostazol-induced AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that cilostazol-induced AMPK activation occurs through a signalling pathway independent of cyclic AMP. Cilostazol also dose-dependently inhibited tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)-induced NF-kappa B activation and TNF alpha-induced I kappa B kinase activity. Furthermore, cilostazol attenuated the TNF alpha-induced gene expression of various pro-inflammatory and cell adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and PECAM-1 in HUVEC.

This classification scheme is probably an imprecise predictor of the prognosis of an individual patient. Indeed, approximately 25 percent of patients with stage IA disease have a recurrence after surgery, suggesting the need to identify patients in this subgroup for more effective therapy. METHODS: We identified gene-expression profiles that predicted the risk of recurrence in a cohort of 89 patients with early-stage NSCLC (the lung metagene model). We evaluated the predictor in two independent groups of 25 patients from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0030 study and 84 patients from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9761 study. RESULTS: The lung metagene model predicted recurrence for individual patients significantly better than did clinical prognostic factors and was consistent across all early stages of NSCLC. Applied to the cohorts from the ACOSOG Z0030 trial and the CALGB 9761 trial, the lung metagene model had an overall predictive accuracy of 72 percent and 79 percent, respectively. The predictor also identified a subgroup of patients with stage IA disease who were at high risk for recurrence and who might be best treated by adjuvant chemotherapy.

Movement of the signal is initially limited to a few cells, but in some cases the signal can be amplified and travel over larger distances. How far silencing initiated by other classes of plant small RNAs (sRNAs) than siRNAs can extend has been less clear. Using a system based on the silencing of the CH42 gene, we have tracked the mobility of silencing signals initiated in phloem companion cells by artificial microRNAs (miRNA) and trans-acting siRNA (tasiRNA) that have the same primary sequence. In this system, both the ta-siRNA and the miRNA act at a distance. Non-autonomous effects of the miRNA can be triggered by several different miRNA precursors deployed as backbones. While the tasiRNA also acts non-autonomously, it has a much greater range than the miRNA or hairpin-derived siRNAs directed against CH42, indicating that biogenesis can determine the non-autonomous effects of sRNAs.

The endogenous short interfering (si) RNA involved in this pathway are processed by Dicer-like nucleases from genomic loci re-arranged to form extended inverted repeats (IRs) that produce perfect or near-perfect dsRNA molecules. Although such IR loci are commonly detected in plant genomes, their genetics, evolution and potential contribution to plant biology through endogenous silencing have remained largely unexplored. Through an exhaustive analysis performed using Arabidopsis, we provide here evidence that at least two such endogenous IRs are genetically virtually indistinguishable from the transgene constructs commonly used for RNAi in plants. We show how these loci can be useful probes of the cellular mechanism and fluidity of RNA-silencing pathways in plants, and provide evidence that they may arise and disappear on an ecotype scale, show highly cell-specific expression patterns and respond to various stresses. IR loci thus have the potential to act as molecular sensors of the local environments found within distinct ecological plant niches. We further show that the various siRNA size classes produced by at least one of these IR loci are functionally loaded into cognate effector proteins and mediate both post-transcriptional gene silencing and RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) of endogenous as well as exogenous targets. Finally, and as previously reported during plant experimental RNAi, we provide evidence that endogenous IR-derived siRNAs of all size classes are not cell-autonomous and can be transported through graft junctions over long distances, in target tissues where they are functional, at least in mediating RdDM. Collectively, these results define the existence of a bona fide, endogenous and systemic RNAi pathway in plants that may have implications in adaptation, epiallelism and trans-generational memory.

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs), serum and lung homogenates were collected for analysis of cells and inflammatory mediators. Contractile responses of lobar-bronchus segments to agonists were functionally tested. Pulmonary tissues were investigated using histological examination. The results showed that the sensitized 'model E3 rats' exhibited an increase in the total amount of inflammatory cells, primarily eosinophils, in BALF and pulmonary tissue, as well as epithelial damage. Serum levels of IgE increased and so did the levels of nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase, TNF-alpha and IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in lung homogenate and serum. Furthermore, the contractile responses in bronchi induced by endothelin-1, sarafotoxin 6c and bradykinin increased and isoprenaline-induced relaxations decreased.

Methods and Objectives: We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design study in 38 patients with moderate asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroids but symptomatic during a run-in phase. Infliximab (5 mg/kg) or placebo was administered by intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. We assessed clinical response by monitoring lung function, symptoms, and inhaled beta(2)-agonist usage using hand-held electronic devices. Results: The primary endpoint, change in morning PEF at Days 50-56 compared with the last 7 d of the run-in, was not significantly different on treatment. However, infliximab was associated with a decrease in mean diurnal variation of PEF at Week 8 (p = 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], -8.1 to -0.72). Furthermore, there was a decrease in the number of patients with exacerbations of asthma (p = 0.01; 95% CI, 4.4 to 52.7) and an increased probability of freedom from exacerbation with time (p = 0.03) in patients on infliximab (n = 14) compared with placebo (n = 18). In addition, infliximab decreased levels of TNF-alpha (p = 0.01) and other cytokines in sputum supernatants. There were no serious adverse events related to the study agent.

Background: Postoperative bile duct injuries require multidisciplinary management. In recent years, advancements have occurred in patient evaluation and in timing and type of therapy. Methods: A multidisciplinary team managed 528 patients over 18 years. Mean age was 52 years; 69% were women and 95% had a cholecystectomy and/or bile duct exploration. Patients were classified by the Strasberg system as having bile leaks (type A, n = 239, 45%) or bile duct injuries (types B-E, n = 289, 55%). Injury outcomes from 1993 to 2003 (n = 132) were compared with those from 2004 to 2010 (n = 157). A successful outcome was defined as no need for further intervention after the initial 12 months of therapy. Standard statistical methods were employed. Results: Patients with bile leaks were managed almost exclusively by endoscopists (96%) with a 96% success rate. Patients with bile duct injuries were managed most often by endoscopists (N = 115, 40%) followed by surgeons (N = 104, 36%) and interventional radiologists (N = 70, 24%). Overall success rates were best for surgery (88%, P < 0.05) followed by endoscopy (76%) and interventional radiology (50%) and improved over time (78% vs 69%). Outcomes were best for surgery in recent years (95% vs 80%, P < 0.05) and for patients stented for more than 6 months (P < 0.01).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate management and short- and long-term outcomes of patients with major complications after cholecystectomy. Methods: Data were analysed for 54 patients who underwent operation for major bile duct injuries after cholecystectomy between January 1990 and January 2002. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for the development of biliary complications. Results: Complete follow-up data were available for all 54 patients (median duration 61.9 (range 2.6-154.3) months). All underwent Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Three patients (6 per cent) died from biliary tract complications during follow-up. Long-term biliary complications occurred in ten patients (19 per cent). Nine patients developed biliary stricture of whom five developed secondary biliary cirrhosis. A successful long-term result was achieved in 50 (93 per cent) of 54 patients, including those who required subsequent procedures. Biliary reconstruction in the presence of peritonitis (P = 0.002), combined vascular and bile duct injuries (P = 0.029), and injury at or above the level of the biliary bifurcation (P = 0.012) were significant independent predictors of poor outcome.

In this study, we compared the cognitive status of a geriatric population undergoing ophthalmic surgery, as assessed by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) before and after ketamine administration. METHODS: Eighty patients were enrolled and randomly assigned in a double-blind study to receive either ketamine (0.3 mg/kg dose) or physiologic solution (control group). Sixty-five (control, n = 32; ketamine, n = 33) patients completed the trial. Cognitive performance was assessed with an abbreviated version of the SPMSQ. Measurements of analgesia, sedation, intraocular pressure, and hemodynamic variables were recorded. RESULTS: With respect to cognitive performance, the baseline evaluation was similar for the control and ketamine groups. Postoperative evaluation showed an improvement only in the ketamine group. No increase in intraocular pressure or a secondary nystagmus was observed. The average dose of midazolam was higher in the control group, but the difference was not clinically significant. After surgery, analgesic behavior was better in the ketamine group than in the control group. There were no differences between groups in the sedation scale or in hemodynamic variables. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of 0.3 mg/kg ketamine during ophthalmic surgery in geriatric patients changed their cognitive status as assessed by the SPMSQ, decreased the required dose of anesthetics, and produced no increase in intraocular pressure or in hemodynamic variables.

Both ketamine doses decreased the serum IL-6 response at ICU arrival and POD 1 compared with placebo (p < 0.05). CRP was lower in the 0.5-mg/kg group than placebo on POD 1 (p = 0.003). IL-10 was lower in the ketamine groups (p = 0.01) at POD 1 compared with placebo; IL-8 levels were not affected by ketamine.

This article evaluates the performance of CbPD in detecting plagiarism with various degrees of disguise in a collection of 185,000 biomedical articles. We benchmark CbPD against two character-based detection approaches using a ground truth approximated in a user study.

We have set up such a system in Arabidopsis thaliana and used it to compare the effects of five unrelated viral silencing suppressors on the siRNA and miRNA pathways. Although all the suppressors inhibited RNAi, only three of them induced developmental defects, indicating that the two pathways are only partially overlapping. These developmental defects were remarkably similar, and their penetrance correlated with inhibition of miRNA-guided cleavage of endogenous transcripts and not with altered miRNA accumulation per se. Among the suppressors investigated, the tombusviral P19 protein coimmunoprecipitated with siRNA duplexes and miRNA duplexes corresponding to the primary cleavage products of miRNA precursors. Thus, it is likely that P19 prevents RNA silencing by sequestering both classes of small RNAs. Moreover, the finding here that P19 binds siRNAs and suppresses RNAi in Hela cells also suggests that this factor may be useful to dissect the RNA silencing pathways in animals. Finally, the differential effects of the silencing suppressors tested here upon other types of Arabidopsis silencing-related small RNAs revealed a surprising variety of biosynthetic and, presumably, functional pathways for those molecules. Therefore, silencing suppressors are valuable probes of the complexity of RNA silencing.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1040-4651,1532-298X,,NA,NA,MAY,2004,16,5,,,,NA,1235,1250,,10.1105/tpc.020719,NA,NA,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,NA,WOS:000221461400013,15084715,970,1,"Probing the MicroRNA and Small Interfering RNA Pathways with Virus-Encoded Suppressors of RNA Silencing (Retraction of vol 16, pg 1235, 2004)",1,probing the microrna and small interfering rna pathways with virus-encoded suppressors of rna silencing,probing the microrna and small interfering rna pathways with virus-encoded suppressors of rna silencing,TRUE,unable to find,02-Jun-15,May-04,,2015,2004

Although HDACs are recruited to gene promoters and DNA hypersensitive sites through interactions with DNA binding factors, HDAC activities are also found globally in intergenic regions where DNA binding factors are not present. It is suggested that HDACs are recruited to those regions through other distinct, yet undefined mechanisms. Here we show that HDACs can be directly recruited to chromatin in the absence of other factors through direct interactions with both DNA and core histone subunits. HDACs interact with DNA in a non-sequence specific manner. HDAC1 and p300 directly bind to the overlapping regions of the histone H3 tail and compete for histone binding. Previously we show that p300 can acetylate HDAC1 to attenuate deacetylase activity. Here we have further mapped two distinct regions of HDAC1 that interact with p300. Interestingly, these regions of HDAC1 also associate with histone H3. More importantly, p300 and HDAC1 compete for chromatin binding both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the mutually exclusive associations of HDAC1/p300, p300/histone, and HDAC1/histone on chromatin contribute to the dynamic regulation of histone acetylation by balancing HDAC or KAT activity present at histones to reorganize chromatin structure and regulate transcription.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1932-6203,,,NA,NA,10-Apr,2014,9,4,,,,,,,e94523,10.1371/journal.pone.0094523,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000336909100089,24722339,3101,J,"Degenhardt, T; Vaisanen, S; Rakhshandehroo, M; Kersten, S; Carlberg, C",NA,,NA,"Degenhardt, Tatjana; Vaisanen, Sami; Rakhshandehroo, Maryam; Kersten, Sander; Carlberg, Carsten",NA,,"Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor alpha Controls Hepatic Heme Biosynthesis Through ALAS1 (Retraction of vol 388, pg 225, 2009)",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,"Carlberg, Carsten/C-9075-2011","Carlberg, Carsten/0000-0003-2633-0684",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0022-2836,,,NA,NA,19-Nov,2010,404,1,,NA,,NA,172,172,,10.1016/j.jmb.2010.09.037,,NA,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,NA,WOS:000284674000013,NA,NA,2009,"Degenhardt, T"," Vaisanen, S"," Rakhshandehroo, M"," Kersten, S"," Carlberg, C",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Degenhardt, T; Vaisanen, S; Rakhshandehroo, M; Kersten, S; Carlberg, C",NA,,NA,"Degenhardt, Tatjana; Vaisanen, Sami; Rakhshandehroo, Maryam; Kersten, Sander; Carlberg, Carsten",NA,,"Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor alpha controls Hepatic Heme Biosynthesis Through ALAS1 (Retracted article.

ALAS' (5-aminolevulinate synthase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in heme synthesis in the liver and is highly regulated to adapt to the metabolic demand of the hepatocyte. In the present study, we describe human hepatic ALAS1 as a new direct target for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). In primary human hepatocytes and in HepG2 cells, PPAR alpha agonists induced an increase in ALAS1 mRNA levels, which was abolished by PPAR alpha silencing. These effects are mediated by two functional PPAR binding sites at positions -9 and -2.3 kb relative to the ALAS1 transcription start site. PPAR alpha ligand treatment also up-regulated the mRNA levels of the genes ALAD (5-aminolevulinate dehydratase), UROS (uroporphyrinogen III synthase), UROD (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase), CPOX (coproporphyrinogen oxidase) and PPOX (protoporphyrinogen oxidise) encoding for enzymes controlling further steps in heme biosynthesis. In HepG2 cells treated with PPAR alpha agonists and in mouse liver upon fasting, the association of PPAR alpha, its partner retinoid X receptor, PPAR gamma coactivator 1 alpha and activated RNA polymerase II with the transcription start site region of all six genes was increased, leading to higher levels of the metabolite heme. In conclusion, these data strongly support a role of PPAR alpha in the regulation of human ALAS1 and of five additional genes of the pathway, consequently leading to increased heme synthesis.

We substituted either or both glycines of this GXXXG motif with leucines to evaluate the impact on drug transport, ATP hydrolysis, cross-linking, and susceptibility to degradation. All mutants also carried the R482G gain-of-function mutation, and all migrated to the cell surface. The mutations resulted in lost transport for rhodamine 123 and impaired mitoxantrone, pheophorbide a, and BODIPY-prazosin transport, particularly in the double leucine mutant (G406L/G410L). Basal ATPase activity of the G406L/G410L mutant was comparable to the empty vector transfected cells with no substrate induction. Despite impaired function, the mutants retained susceptibility to cross-linking using either disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) or the reducible dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) and demonstrated a high molecular weight complex under nonreducing conditions. Mutations to alanine at the same positions yielded fully functional transporters. Finally, we exposed cells to mitoxantrone to promote folding and processing of the mutant proteins, which in the leucine mutants resulted in increased amounts detected on immunoblot and by immunofluorescence.

Runt-related transcription factor 3 (Runx3), a gene known to negatively regulate allergic airway disease, was found to be excessively methylated, and Runx3 mRNA and protein levels were suppressed in progeny exposed in utero to a high-methylation diet. Moreover, treatment with a demethylating agent increased Runx3 gene transcription, further supporting our claim that a methyl-rich diet can affect methylation status and consequent transcriptional regulation.

Two distinct alphasatellites. Gossypium darwinii symptomless alphasatellite and Gossypium mustelinium symptomless alphasatellite, were previously isolated from Gossypium davidsonii and G. mustelinium. Here we show that the replication-associated proteins (Rep: a rolling-circle replication initiator protein) encoded by these alphasatellites interact with the Rep and C4 proteins encoded by their helper begomovirus, Cotton leaf curl Rajasthan virus (CLCuRaV), in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Both the alphasatellite-encoded Reps were found to have strong gene silencing suppressor activity, in contrast to the betasatellite-encoded beta C1 and CLCuRaV-encoded C2, C4 and V2 proteins. The presence of alphasatellites maintained suppression of gene silencing in the youngest, actively growing tissue of CLCuRaV-betasatellite-infected plants. This is the first demonstration of a rolling-circle replication initiator protein with suppressor of gene silencing activity and provides a possible explanation for the selective advantage provided by the association of alphasatellites with begomovirus-betasatellite complexes.

Two opposite concepts try to explain its causes and mechanisms - programmed aging and aging of ""wear and tear"" (stochastic aging). To date, much evidence has been obtained that contradicts the theories of aging as being due to accumulation of various damages. For example, creation of adequate conditions for the functioning of the organism's components (appropriate microenvironment, humoral background, etc.) has been shown to cause partial or complete reversibility of signs of its aging. Programmed aging and death of an organism can be termed phenoptosis by analogy to the term apoptosis for programmed cell death (this term was first suggested by V. P. Skulachev). The necessity of this phenomenon, since A. Weismann, has been justified by the need for population renewal according to ecological and evolutionary requirements. Species-specific lifespan, age-dependent changes in expression pattern of genes, etc. are compatible with the concept of phenoptosis. However, the intraspecific rate of aging was shown to vary over of a wide range depending on living conditions. This means that the ""aging program"" is not set rigidly; it sensitively adjusts an individual to the specific realities of its habitat. Moreover, there are indications that in rather severe conditions of natural habitat the aging program can be completely cancelled, as the need for it disappears because of the raised mortality from external causes (high extrinsic mortality), providing fast turnover of the population.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0006-2979,,,NA,NA,SEP,2013,78,9,,,,,1001,1005,,10.1134/S0006297913090058,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000324375500005,24228921,206,J,"Mayack, SR; Shadrach, JL; Kim, FS; Wagers, AJ",NA,,NA,"Mayack, Shane R.; Shadrach, Jennifer L.; Kim, Francis S.; Wagers, Amy J.",NA,,"Systemic signals regulate ageing and rejuvenation of blood stem cell niches (Retraction of vol 463, pg 495, 2010)",NATURE,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-0836,,,NA,NA,14-Oct,2010,467,7317,,NA,,NA,872,872,,10.1038/nature09474,,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000282898700073,NA,NA,2010,"Mayack, SR"," Shadrach, JL"," Kim, FS"," Wagers, AJ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Mayack, SR; Shadrach, JL; Kim, FS; Wagers, AJ",NA,,NA,"Mayack, Shane R.; Shadrach, Jennifer L.; Kim, Francis S.; Wagers, Amy J.",NA,,"Systemic signals regulate ageing and rejuvenation of blood stem cell niches (Retracted article.

We examined the value of these strategies as rational approaches to develop heart rate-reducing agents and ""biological pacemakers"" by manipulating the expression of the cardiac pacemaker channel genes HCN2 and HCN4. We showed that the gene-specific microRNA mimics, 22-nt RNAs designed to target the 3'untranslated regions (3UTRs) of HCN2 and HCN4, respectively, were efficient in abrogating expression and function of HCN2 and HCN4. The gene-specific microRNA mimics repressed protein levels, accompanied by depressed f-channel conductance and the associated rhythmic activity, without affecting mRNA levels of HCN2 and HCN4. Meanwhile, we also designed the microRNA-masking antisense based on the miR-1 and miR-133 target sites in the 3'UTRs of HCN2 and HCN4 and found that these antisense oligodeoxynucleotides markedly enhanced HCN2/HCN4 expression and function, as reflected by increased protein levels of HCN2/HCN4 and if conductance, by removing the repression of HCN2/HCN4 expression induced by endogenous miR-1/miR-133.

In parallel, expression signatures that define the status of oncogenic signaling pathways were evaluated in 119 primary ovarian cancers and 12 ovarian cancer cell lines. In an effort to increase chemotherapy sensitivity, pathways shown to be activated in platinum-resistant cancers were subject to targeted therapy in ovarian cancer cell lines. Results Gene expression profiles identified patients with ovarian cancer likely to be resistant to primary platinum-based chemotherapy with greater than 80% accuracy.

Data sources Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, Biosis Previews, Science Citation Index Expanded, CINAHL, Current Controlled Trials, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Centerwatch to September 2012; hand search of reference lists and other systematic reviews; contact with authors and relevant pharmaceutical companies. Study selection Eligible trials were randomised clinical trials comparing hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.38-0.45 with either crystalloid or human albumin in patients with sepsis. Published and unpublished trials were included irrespective of language and predefined outcomes. Data extraction Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data on methods, interventions, outcomes, and risk of bias. Risk ratios and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were estimated with fixed and random effects models. Results Nine trials that randomised 3456 patients with sepsis were included. Overall, hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.38-0.45 versus crystalloid or albumin did not affect the relative risk of death (1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.22, 3414 patients, eight trials), but in the predefined analysis of trials with low risk of bias the relative risk of death was 1.11 (1.00 to 1.23, trial sequential analysis (TSA) adjusted 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.29, 3016 patients, four trials). In the hydroxyethyl starch group, renal replacement therapy was used more (1.36, 1.08 to 1.72, TSA adjusted 1.03 to 1.80, 1311 patients, five trials), and the relative risk of acute kidney injury was 1.18 (0.99 to 1.40, TSA adjusted 0.90 to 1.54, 994 patients, four trials). More patients in the hydroxyethyl starch group were transfused with red blood cells (1.29, 1.13 to 1.48, TSA adjusted 1.10 to 1.51, 973 patients, three trials), and more patients had serious adverse events (1.30, 1.02 to 1.67, TSA adjusted 0.93 to 1.83, 1069 patients, four trials). The transfused volume of red blood cells did not differ between the groups (mean difference 65 mL, 95% confidence interval -20 to 149 mL, three trials). Conclusion In conventional meta-analyses including recent trial data, hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.38-0.45 versus crystalloid or albumin increased the use of renal replacement therapy and transfusion with red blood cells, and resulted in more serious adverse events in patients with sepsis.

Plasma concentrations of vasopressin, endothelin-1, adrenaline, noradrenaline, atrial natriuretic peptide and 6-keto-prostaglandin F-1 alpha were measured from arterial blood samples. All measurements were carried out on the day of admission to the intensive care unit (trauma patients) or on diagnosis of sepsis, and daily over the next 5 days at 12:00.

Fifty plaque ruptures (mean, 2.08 per patient; range, 0 to 6) were diagnosed by the association of a ruptured capsule with intraplaque cavity. Plaque rupture on the culprit lesion was found in 9 patients (37.5%). At least 1 plaque rupture was found somewhere other than on the culprit lesion in 19 patients (79%). These lesions were in a different artery than the culprit artery in 70.8% and were in both other arteries in 12.5% of these 24 patients. Complete IVUS examination of all 3 coronary axes in patients who had experienced a first ACS revealed that multiple atherosclerotic plaque ruptures were detected by IVUS; these multiple ruptures were present simultaneously with the culprit lesion; they were frequent and located (in three quarters of cases) on the 3 principal coronary trunks; and the multiple plaque ruptures in locations other than on the culprit lesion were less severe, nonstenosing, and less calcified.

Patients and Methods A gene expression model that predicts response to platinum-based therapy was developed using a training set of 83 advanced-stage serous ovarian cancers and tested on a 36-sample external validation set. In parallel, expression signatures that define the status of oncogenic signaling pathways were evaluated in 119 primary ovarian cancers and 12 ovarian cancer cell lines. In an effort to increase chemotherapy sensitivity, pathways shown to be activated in platinum-resistant cancers were subject to targeted therapy in ovarian cancer cell lines. Results Gene expression profiles identified patients with ovarian cancer likely to be resistant to primary platinum-based chemotherapy with greater than 80% accuracy. In patients with platinum-resistant disease, we identified expression signatures consistent with activation of Src and Rb/E2F pathways, components of which were successfully targeted to increase response in ovarian cancer cell lines.

Methods 12 children (mean age 6 years [range 3-10], 11 boys) were referred to a paediatric gastroenterology unit with a history of normal development followed by loss of acquired skills, including language, together with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Children underwent gastroenterological, neurological, and developmental assessment and review of developmental records. Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy sampling, magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and lumbar puncture were done under sedation. Barium follow-through radiography was done where possible. Biochemical, haematological, and immunological profiles were examined. Findings Onset of behavioural symptoms was associated, by the parents, with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination in eight of the 12 children, with measles infection in one child, and otitis media in another. All 12 children had intestinal abnormalities, ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration. Histology showed patchy chronic inflammation in the colon in 11 children and reactive ileal lymphoid hyperplasia in seven, but no granulomas. Behavioural disorders included autism (nine), disintegrative psychosis (one), and possible postviral or vaccinal encephalitis (two). There were no focal neurological abnormalities and MRI and EEG tests were normal. Abnormal laboratory results were significantly raised urinary methylmalonic acid compared with age-matched controls (p=0.003), low haemoglobin in four children, and a low serum IgA in four children.

Recently, DAPK has also been shown to be a critical regulator of autophagy, a catabolic process whereby the cell consumes cytoplasmic contents and organelles within specialized vesicles, called autophagosomes. Here we present the latest findings demonstrating how DAPK modulates autophagy. DAPK positively contributes to the induction stage of autophagosome nucleation by modulating the Vps34 class III phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase complex by two independent mechanisms. The first involves a kinase cascade in which DAPK phosphorylates protein kinase D, which then phosphorylates and activates Vps34. In the second mechanism, DAPK directly phosphorylates Beclin 1, a necessary component of the Vps34 complex, thereby releasing it from its inhibitor, Bcl-2. In addition to these established pathways, we will discuss additional connections between DAPK and autophagy and potential mechanisms that still remain to be fully validated. These include myosin-dependent trafficking of Atg9-containing vesicles to the sites of autophagosome formation, membrane fusion events that contribute to expansion of the autophagosome membrane and maturation through the endocytic pathway, and trafficking to the lysosome on microtubules.

The mechanisms of cell death induced by PM02734 remain unknown. Experimental Design: Human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines H322 and A549 were used to evaluate PM02734-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and autophagy, as well as effects on cell death-related signaling pathways. Results: PM02734 at clinically achievable concentrations (0.5-1 mu mol/L) was cytotoxic to H322 and A549 cells but did not cause nuclear fragmentation, PARP cleavage, or caspase activation, suggesting that classical apoptosis is not its main mechanism of cell death. In contrast, PM02734-induced cell death was associated with several characteristics of autophagy, including an increase in acidic vesicular organelle content, levels of GFP-LC3-positive puncta, elevation of the levels of Atg-5/12 and LC3-II, and an associated compromise of the autophagic flux resulting in increased number of autophagosomes and/or autolysosomes. Cotreatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and downregulation of Atg-5 gene expression by siRNA partially inhibited PM02734-induced cell death. PM02734 caused inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling pathways and cotreatment with the Akt inhibitor wortmannin or with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin led to a significant increase in PM02734-induced cell death. Furthermore, PM02734 caused the activation of death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) by dephosphorylation at Ser308, and downregulation of DAPK expression with siRNA caused also a partial but significant reduction of PM02734-induced cell death. In vivo, PM02734 significantly inhibited subcutaneous A549 tumor growth in nude mice (P < 0.05) in association with induction of autophagy. Conclusions: Our data indicate that PM02734 causes cell death by a complex mechanism that involves increased autophagosome content, due for the most part to impairment of autophagic flux, inhibition of the Akt/mTOR pathway, and activation of DAPK. This unique mechanism of action justifies the continued development of this agent for the treatment of NSCLC. Clin Cancer Res; 17(16); 5353-66.

The occurrence of these defects starting from early life stages points at altered developmental neurogenesis as their major determinant. The goal of our study was to obtain comparative evidence for impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of DS fetuses and Ts65Dn mice, an animal model for DS. Cell proliferation in human fetuses was evaluated with Ki-67 (a marker of cells in S + G(2) + M phases of cell cycle) and cyclin A (a marker of cells in S phase) immunohistochemistry. We found that in the DC of DS fetuses the number of proliferating cells was notably reduced when compared with controls. A similar reduction was observed in the germinal matrix of the lateral ventricle. in both structures, DS fetuses showed a reduced ratio between cyclin A- and Ki-67-positive cells when compared with controls, indicating that they had a reduced number of cycling cells in S phase. In the DG of P2 Ts65Dn mice cell proliferation, assessed 2 h after an injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), was notably reduced, similarly to DS fetuses. After 28 days, Ts65Dn mice had still less BrdU-positive cells than controls. Phenotypic analysis of the surviving cells showed that Ts65Dn mice had a percent number of cells with astrocytic phenotype larger than controls. Using phospho-histone H3 immunohistochemistry we found that both DS fetuses and P2 Ts65Dn mice had a higher number of proliferating cells in G2 and a smaller number of cells in M phase of cell cycle. Results provide novel evidence for proliferation impairment in the hippocampal DG of the DS fetal brain, comparable to that of the P2 mouse model, and suggest that cell cycle alterations may be critical determinants of the reduced proliferation potency.

(Salen)Mn(III) compounds have been proven to be promising as synthetic antioxidants that, in particular, dismutate H2O2, resulting in two water molecules and oxygen. An understanding of the mechanism of the dismutation process is an important basis for rational design and tuning these analogues to yield better therapeutic properties. In addition, the study of the catalytic mechanism of the functional biomimetics of enzymes might contribute to a better understanding of the complex enzymatic activities for the corresponding biological compounds. For the first time, using the density functional theory method, we have performed a quantum chemical investigation of the catalase activity of the (salen)Mn(III) compound. The real compound reacting with a peroxide molecule has been utilized in the calculations to avoid uncertainties connected with using incomplete models. The reaction has been studied on three different spin potential energy surfaces: the singlet, the triplet, and the quintet. The same H2O2 dismutation process has been also calculated with participation of an additional water molecule to check the possible explicit involvement of the solvent molecules in the proton-transfer process in the course of the reaction. Our findings suggest that the first part of the dismutation reaction-the metal oxidation by a peroxide molecule-is a one-step process. The concerted breaking of the O-O peroxide bond, oxidation of the Mn, and a water molecule formation occur on the triplet state potential energy surface. This process can be done effectively at the Mn catalytic center with only 3.6 kcal/mol of activation energy needed. No energetic advantages were found for the assisted proton-transfer mechanism with participation of an ancillary water molecule. Although the singlet state is not accessible on the reactant and TS parts of the reaction potential surface, it becomes the ground state in the vicinity of the final geometry and can play an important role in the second part of the dismutation process.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1520-6106,,,NA,NA,26-Feb,2004,108,8,,,,,2708,2711,,10.1021/jp036905r,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000189152000032,NA,65,J,"Taub, J; Lau, JF; Ma, C; Hahn, JH; Hoque, R; Rothblatt, J; Chalfie, M",NA,,NA,"Taub, J; Lau, JF; Ma, C; Hahn, JH; Hoque, R; Rothblatt, J; Chalfie, M",NA,,"A cytosolic catalase is needed to extend adult lifespan in C. elegans daf-C and clk-1 mutants (Retraction of vol 399, pg 162, 1999)",NATURE,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-0836,,,NA,NA,13-Feb,2003,421,6924,,NA,,NA,764,764,,10.1038/nature01425,,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000180938000049,12610632,NA,1999,"Taub, J"," Lau, JF"," Ma, C"," Hahn, JH"," Hoque, R"," Rothblatt, J"," Chalfie, M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Taub, J; Lau, JF; Ma, C; Hahn, JH; Hoque, R; Rothblatt, J; Chalfie, M",NA,,NA,"Taub, J; Lau, JF; Ma, C; Hahn, JH; Hoque, R; Rothblatt, J; Chalfie, M",NA,,"A cytosolic catalase is needed to extend adult lifespan in C-elegans daf-C and clk-1 mutants (Retracted Article.

The sampling of the 12-dimensional configuration hyperspace of vinyl bromide prior to execution of the electronic structure calculations is accomplished by combining novelty-sampling methods, chemical intuition, and trajectory sampling on empirical and neural network surfaces. The final potential is obtained using a two-layer feed-forward neural network comprising 38 and 1 neurons, respectively, with hyperbolic tangent sigmoid and linear transfer functions in the hidden and output layers, respectively. The fitting is accomplished using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with early stopping and Bayesian regularization methods to avoid overfitting. The interpolated potentials have a standard deviation from the ab initio results of 0.0578 eV, which is within the range generally regarded as ""chemical accuracy"" for the purposes of electronic structure calculations. It is shown that the potential surface may be easily and conveniently transferred from one research group to another. The files required for transfer of the vinyl bromide surface can be obtained from the Electronic Physics Auxiliary Publication Service. Total dissociation rate coefficients for vinyl bromide are obtained at five different excitation energies between 4.50 and 6.44 eV. Branching ratios into each of the six open reaction channels are computed at 24 vibrational energies in the range between 4.00 and 6.44 eV. The distribution of vibrational energies in HBr formed via three-center dissociation from vinyl bromide is determined and compared with previous theoretical and experimental results. It is concluded that the combination of ab initio electronic structure calculations, novelty sampling with chemical intuition and trajectories on empirical analytic surfaces, and feed-forward neural networks provides a viable framework in which to execute purely ab initio molecular-dynamics studies on complex systems with multiple open reaction channels.

Pharmacological inhibition of the renin angiotensin system has proven clinical efficacy in nephropathies of various origins, including diabetic nephropathy. We tested the effects of the dual inhibition of both angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase by the vasopeptidase inhibitor AVE7688 in an animal model of Type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Methods. We treated 56 obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF, Gmi-fa/fa) rats aged 34-weeks with either placebo (n = 9) or the vasopeptidase inhibitor AVE7688 in four different doses (each n = 9; 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg/d in chow). We used 11 heterozygous (+/fa) rats which received placebo and served as non-diabetic, lean controls. Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was assessed as a marker of nephropathy at baseline (age 34-weeks) and after 10 weeks of chronic treatment. Results. All obese animals had established diabetes mellitus that was not influenced by AVE7688 (HbA(1c) >12%, stable in all dose groups). There was massive albuminuria in the homozygous ZDF rats (albumine/creatinine ratio >20 mg/mg vs minimal albuminuria in lean controls) that was decreased by AVE7688 in a dose dependent manner (Placebo 2.0 +/- 4.4 vs 11.9 +/- 1.8, 13.4 +/- 0.7, 13.6 +/- 2.8, and 19.8 +/- 2.8 mg/mg in the 3, 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg/d groups, respectively; all treatment groups p < 0.05 vs Placebo).

Methods 336 patients with non-diabetic renal disease were enrolled from one renal outpatient department in Japan. After screening and an 18-week run-in period, 263 patients were randomly assigned angiotensin-II receptor blocker (losartan, 100 mg daily), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril, 3 mg daily), or a combination of both drugs at equivalent doses. Survival analysis was done to compare the effects of each regimen on the combined primary endpoint of time to doubling of serum creatinine concentration or endstage renal disease. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings Seven patients discontinued or were otherwise lost to follow-up.

However, CSF-1 also regulates some of the key effector functions of macrophages (e. g., phagocytosis and cytokine secretion). The endosomal SNARE protein syntaxin 7 (Stx7) regulates vesicle trafficking events involved in phagocytosis and cytokine secretion. Therefore, we investigated the ability of CSF-1 to regulate Stx7. CSF-1 upregulated Stx7 expression in primary mouse macrophages; it also upregulated expression of its SNARE partners Vti1b and VAMP8 but not Stx8. Additionally, CSF-1 induced the rapid serine phosphorylation of Stx7 and enhanced its binding to Vti1b, Stx8, and VAMP8. Bioinformatics analysis and results from experiments with kinase inhibitors suggested the CSF-1-induced phosphorylation of Stx7 was mediated by protein kinase C and Akt in response to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation.

However, it was unclear whether the anti-A beta antibodies were able to distinguish A beta peptide from the same A beta epitopes within the amyloid precursor protein (APP). To further elucidate the identity of the immunoreactive intraneuronal material in 3xTg-AD mice, we conducted immunohistochemical, biochemical, and ultrastructural studies using a well characterized panel of antibodies that distinguish A beta within APP from cleaved A beta peptides. We found that the intraneuronal material shared epitopes with full-length APP but not free A beta.

Ferroportin is the only known mechanism for export of intracellular non-heme-associated iron; its stability is regulated by the hormone hepcidin. Although ferroportin profoundly affects concentrations of intracellular iron in tissues important for systemic iron absorption and trafficking, ferroportin concentrations in breast cancer and their influence on growth and prognosis have not been examined. We demonstrate here that both ferroportin and hepcidin are expressed in cultured human breast epithelial cells and that hepcidin regulates ferroportin in these cells. Further, ferroportin protein is substantially reduced in breast cancer cells compared to nonmalignant breast epithelial cells; ferroportin protein abundance correlates with metabolically available iron. Ferroportin protein is also present in normal human mammary tissue and markedly decreased in breast cancer tissue, with the highest degree of anaplasia associated with lowest ferroportin expression. Transfection of breast cancer cells with ferroportin significantly reduces their growth after orthotopic implantation in the mouse mammary fat pad. Gene expression profiles in breast cancers from >800 women reveal that decreased ferroportin gene expression is associated with a significant reduction in metastasis-free and disease-specific survival that is independent of other breast cancer risk factors.

These agents not only inhibit respiratory function and cause constipation, but also induce other significant side effects such as addiction and tolerance, all of which further contribute to a reduced quality of life for cancer patients. Thus, in the present study, the effects of electro-acupuncture treatment (EA) on mechanical allodynia were examined in a cancer pain mouse model. Methods: In order to produce a neuropathic cancer pain model, S-180 sarcoma cells were inoculated around the sciatic nerve of left legs of Balb/c mice. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning confirmed the mass of S-180 cancer cells embedded around the sciatic nerve. Mechanical allodynia was most consistently induced in the mouse sarcoma cell line S-180 (2 x 10(6) sarcoma cells)-treated group compared to all the other groups studied. EA stimulation (2 Hz) was administered daily to ST36 (Zusanli) of S-180 bearing mice for 30 min for 9 days after S-180 inoculation. Results: EA treatment significantly prolonged paw withdrawal latency from 5 days after inoculation. It also shortened the cumulative lifting duration from 7 days after inoculation, compared to the tumor control. Also, the overexpression of pain peptide substance P in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord was significantly decreased in the EA-treated group compared to the tumor control on Day 9 post inoculation. Furthermore, EA treatment effectively increased the concentration of beta-endorphin in blood and brain samples of the mice to a greater extent than that of the tumor control as well as the normal group.

However, it was unclear whether the anti-A beta antibodies were able to distinguish A beta peptide from the same A beta epitopes within the amyloid precursor protein (APP). To further elucidate the identity of the immunoreactive intraneuronal material in 3xTg-AD mice, we conducted immunohistochemical, biochemical, and ultrastructural studies using a well characterized panel of antibodies that distinguish A beta within APP from cleaved A beta peptides. We found that the intraneuronal material shared epitopes with full-length APP but not free A beta. To demonstrate unequivocally that this intraneuronal material was not free A beta peptide, we generated 3xTg-AD mice deficient for beta-secretase (BACE), the protease required for A beta generation from APP. In the absence of A beta production, robust intraneuronal APP immunostaining was detected in the 3xTg-AD/BACE(-/-) mice. Finally, we found that the formation of tau lesions was not different between 3xTg-AD versus 3xTg-AD/BACE(-/-) mice, thereby demonstrating that tau pathology forms independently from A beta peptide generation in this mouse model.

However, the incidence of disease in humans due to this pathogen is still very low. This study set out to investigate if there is a difference between strains isolated from human disease cases and those isolated from asymptomatic cattle which would account for the low disease incidence of such a ubiquitous organism. The work presented here has compared human disease strains from both sporadic and outbreak cases with a cross-section, as defined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, of E. coli O157 strains from cattle. Human (n = 22) and bovine (n = 31) strains were genotyped for carriage of the genes for Shiga-like toxin types 1, 2, and 2c; E. coli secreted protein genes espA, espB, and espP; the enterohemolysin gene; eae (intimin); ast (enteroaggregative E. coli stable toxin [EAST]); and genes for common E. coli adhesins. Strains were also phenotyped for hemolysin, EspP, Tir, and EspD expression as well as production of actin and cytoskeletal rearrangement associated with attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions on HeLa cells. The genotyping confirmed that there was little difference between the two groups, including carriage of stx(2) and stx(2c), which was similar in both sets. ast alleles were confirmed to all contain mutations that would prevent EAST expression. espP mutations were found only in cattle strains (5 of 30). Clear differences were observed in the expression of locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded factors between strains and in different media. EspD, as an indicator of LEE4 (espA, -B, and -D) expression, and Tir levels in supernatants were measured. Virtually all strains from both sources could produce EspD in Luria-Bertani broth, although at very different levels. Standard trichloroacetic acid precipitation of secreted proteins from tissue culture medium produced detectable levels of EspD from the majority of strains of human origin (15 of 20) compared with only a few (4 of 20) bovine strains (P < 0.001), which is indicative of much higher levels of protein secretion from the human strains. Addition of bovine serum albumin carrier protein before precipitation and enhanced detection techniques confirmed that EspD could be detected after growth in tissue culture medium for all strains, but levels from strains of human origin were on average 90-fold higher than those from strains of bovine origin. In general, levels of secretion also correlated with ability to form A/E lesions on HeLa cells, with only the high-level protein secretors in tissue culture medium exhibiting a localized adherence phenotype. This research shows significant differences between human- and bovine-derived E. coli O157 (stx(+) eae(+)) strains and their production of certain LEE-encoded virulence factors.

As a result, these siRNAs repressed expression of the E-cadherin gene at the transcriptional level. In addition, disrupting the expression of either one of two DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 or DNMT3B) by specific siRNAs abolished the siRNA-mediated methylation of DNA. Moreover, vector-based siRNAs targeted to the erbB2 (also known as HER2) promoter also induced DNA methylation in MCF-7 cells.

Wild-type (WT) and PEDF-/- mice were exposed to room air (RA) or 0.9 fraction of inspired oxygen from Postnatal Day 5 to 13.

The interactive regulation of lung microvascularization by vascular endothelial growth factor and PEDF was studied in vitro using MFLM-91U cells, a fetal mouse lung endothelial cell line.

Although nearly 40 % of the world's population is at risk of dengue infection, there is currently no effective vaccine or chemotherapy for the disease. Processing of the dengue polyprotein into structural and non-structural proteins in a host, which is essential for assembly of infective virions, is carried out by the combined action of host proteases and the trypsin-like, two-component viral NS2B/NS3 serine protease. Although NS2B strongly stimulates the catalytic NS3 protease domain, the latter is fully active against small substrates and possesses detectable activity against larger substrates, making both forms of the enzyme possible targets for drug design. Ln the crystal structure of a complex of the protease with a Bowman-Birk inhibitor reported here, an Arg residue at the P1 position of the inhibitor is bound in a manner distinctly different from that in other serine proteases of comparable specificity. However, because the regulatory component, NS2B, is not present in the complex, the physiological implications of this observations are currently unclear. The redundant nature of interaction of P1 Arg and Lys residues with Asp129, Tyr150 and Ser163 of the enzyme provides an explanation for the observed behavior of several site-specific mutants of Asp129 in the protease. The strong level of conservation of residues in the protease that interact with the P1 Arg, along with conservation of Arg at P1 of most cleavage sites in other flaviviruses, suggests that observations from this structure are likely to be applicable to many flaviviruses. The structure provides a starting point for design of site-specific mutations to probe the mechanism of catalysis by the catalytic domain, its activation by the regulatory domain and for design of specific inhibitors of enzymatic activity.

Thus, we now have a very good understanding of how each chain contributes to high affinity IL2 binding and signal transduction. In contrast, over the past 30 years the role that IL2 plays in regulating lymphocyte function has involved many surprising twists and turns. For example, IL2 has been shown, paradoxically, to regulate both lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte death.

In this review, we discuss intracellular trafficking and transcytosis of TNF alpha, regulation of TNF alpha transport after stroke, and the effects of TNFa on stroke preconditioning. TNF alpha can activate cytoprotective pathways by pretreatment or persistent exposure to low doses. This explains the paradoxical observation that transport of this proinflammatory cytokine improves the survival and function of hypoxic cells and of mice with stroke. The dual effects of TNF alpha may be related to differential regulation of TNF alpha trafficking downstream to TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors.

This suggests that cytokine induction up-regulates sPLA(2) IIA protein expression, resulting in altered lipid metabolism that contributes to stroke injury. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, characterizations of these adipose-derived precursor cells (ADPC) in the 3-dimensional (3-D) environment, especially within the area of bone-specific composite scaffolds, have been lacking. In this study, ADPC plated on culture flasks or seeded on medical grade polycaprolactone-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds (mPCL-CaP) were able to differentiate along the osteogenic lineages in both 2-D and 3-D environments as assessed with immunohistochemistry of osteo-related proteins, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions and alkaline phosphatase assay. The mPCL-CaP scaffolds provided adipose-derived cells (ADC) with a suitable environment as determined by DNA and metabolic assays, light, confocal and scanning electron microscopy. Flow cytometry revealed ADC to be CD29+, CD44+, CD73+, CD90+ and CD14-, CD31-, CD34-, CD45-, CD71-, and therefore showed the absence of hematopoietic stem cells but possibly the presence of pericytes and mescenchymal stem cells with osteogenic potential.

Here we report that DNA methylation/demethylation is hormonally switched to control transcription of the cytochrome p450 27B1 (CYP27B1) gene. Reflecting vitamin-D-mediated transrepression of the CYP27B1 gene by the negative vitamin D response element (nVDRE)(6,7), methylation of CpG sites ((5m)CpG) is induced by vitamin D in this gene promoter. Conversely, treatment with parathyroid hormone, a hormone known to activate the CYP27B1 gene(8), induces active demethylation of the (5m)CpG sites in this promoter. Biochemical purification of a complex associated with the nVDRE-binding protein (VDIR, also known as TCF3)(6,7) identified two DNA methyl-transferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3B, for methylation of CpG sites(9), as well as a DNA glycosylase, MBD4 (ref. 10). Protein-kinase-C-phosphorylated MBD4 by parathyroid hormone stimulation promotes incision of methylated DNA through glycosylase activity(11), and a base-excision repair process seems to complete DNA demethylation in the MBD4-bound promoter. Such parathyroid-hormone- induced DNA demethylation and subsequent transcriptional derepression are impaired in Mbd4(-/-) mice(12).

The design and development of safer and more efficacious vaccines against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a high-priority target in the world. Recently, baculovirus pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) was described as an attractive gene delivery vehicle in mammalian cells and a potential vector for vaccine development. In the present study, we constructed a recombinant pseudotype baculovirus encoding the JEV envelope (E) protein and demonstrated that it could elicit high protective immunity in mice. Methods Recombinant pseudotype baculovirus (BV-G-E) was generated by inserting JEV E gene fragment into pFastBac-VSV/G vector. BALB/c mice were immunized with BV-G-E and challenged with JEV wild-type strain. The neutralization antibody, interferon (IFN)-gamma expression and release, and survival rate were analysed and compared with the group of immunized with inactivated vaccine and DNA vaccine (pc-E) encoding the same gene of JEV. Results We demonstrated that intramuscular injections of BV-G-E at various doses into mice produced higher levels of JEV-specific neutralizing antibodies, IFN-gamma and better protective efficacy against a lethal challenge with JEV than that of pc-E. Furthermore, BV-G-E. could elicit a higher level of cellular immunity response and provide equal protective efficacy against JEV challenge compared to inactivated vaccine. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that BV-G-E elicited higher levels of protective immunity compared to DNA vaccine and that pseudotype baculovirus-mediated gene delivery can be utilized as an alternative strategy to develop new generations of vaccines against JEV infection.

Methods 12 children (mean age 6 years [range 3-10], 11 boys) were referred to a paediatric gastroenterology unit with a history of normal development followed by loss of acquired skills, including language, together with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Children underwent gastroenterological, neurological, and developmental assessment and review of developmental records. Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy sampling, magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and lumbar puncture were done under sedation. Barium follow-through radiography was done where possible. Biochemical, haematological, and immunological profiles were examined. Findings Onset of behavioural symptoms was associated, by the parents, with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination in eight of the 12 children, with measles infection in one child, and otitis media in another. All 12 children had intestinal abnormalities, ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration. Histology showed patchy chronic inflammation in the colon in 11 children and reactive ileal lymphoid hyperplasia in seven, but no granulomas. Behavioural disorders included autism (nine), disintegrative psychosis (one), and possible postviral or vaccinal encephalitis (two). There were no focal neurological abnormalities and MRI and EEG tests were normal. Abnormal laboratory results were significantly raised urinary methylmalonic acid compared with age-matched controls (p=0.003), low haemoglobin in four children, and a low serum IgA in four children.

However, its role in modulation of cardiac repair after infarction is uncertain. This study tested the hypothesis that Postcon inhibits adverse cardiac repair by reducing degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and synthesis of collagens via modulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1/Smad signaling pathway. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 45 min ischemia followed by 3 h, 7 or 42 days of reperfusion, respectively. In acute studies, four cycles of 10/10 s Postcon significantly reduced infarct size, which was blocked by administration of a mitochondrial K-ATP channel blocker, 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) at reperfusion. In chronic studies, Postcon inhibited MMP activity and preserved ECM from degradation as evidenced by reduced extent of collagen-rich scar and increased mass of viable myocardium. Along with a reduction in collagen synthesis and fibrosis, Postcon significantly down-regulated expression of TGF beta 1 and phospho-Smad2/3, and up-regulated Smad7 as compared to the control, consistent with a reduction in the population of alpha-smooth muscle actin expressing myofibroblasts within the infarcted myocardium. At 42 days of reperfusion, echocardiography showed significant improvements in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction. The wall thickness of the infarcted middle anterior septum in the Postcon was also significantly greater than that in the control. The beneficial effects of Postcon on cardiac repair were comparable to preconditioning and still evident after a blockade with 5-HD.

Although the etiology of this skeletal muscle insulin resistance is multifactorial, there is accumulating evidence that one contributor is overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Angiotensin II ( ANGII) produced from this system can act on ANG II type 1 receptors both in the vascular endothelium and in myocytes, with an enhancement of the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Evidence from animal model and cultured skeletal muscle cell line studies indicates ANG II can induce insulin resistance. Chronic ANG II infusion into an insulin-sensitive rat produces a markedly insulin-resistant state that is associated with a negative impact of ROS on the skeletal muscle glucose transport system. ANG II treatment of L6 myocytes causes impaired insulin receptor substrate ( IRS)-1-dependent insulin signaling that is accompanied by augmentation of NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production. Further critical evidence has been obtained from the TG( mREN2) 27 rat, a model of RAS overactivity and insulin resistance. The TG( mREN2) 27 rat displays whole body and skeletal muscle insulin resistance that is associated with local oxidative stress and a significant reduction in the functionality of the insulin receptor (IR)/ IRS- 1- dependent insulin signaling. Treatment with a selective ANG II type 1 receptor antagonist leads to improvements in whole body insulin sensitivity, enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose transport in muscle, and reduced local oxidative stress. In addition, exercise training of TG( mREN2) 27 rats enhances whole body and skeletal muscle insulin action. However, these metabolic improvements elicited by antagonism of ANG II action or exercise training are independent of upregulation of IR/IRS- 1- dependent signaling. Collectively, these findings support targeting the RAS in the design of interventions to improve metabolic and cardiovascular function in conditions of insulin resistance associated with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0363-6119,,,NA,NA,SEP,2007,293,3,,,,,R974,R980,,10.1152/ajpregu.00147.2007,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000249156000003,17581838,722,J,"Carvalho, CRO; Thirone, ACP; Gontijo, JAR; Velloso, LA; Saad, MJA",NA,,NA,"Carvalho, Carla R.

To reveal the role of MTA1 in mammary gland development, transgenic mice expressing MTA1 under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter long terminal repeat were generated.

Increased ductal growth was also observed in the glands of ovariectomized female mice, as well as of transgenic male mice. MTA1 dysregulation in mammary epithelium and cancer cells triggered downregulation of the progesterone receptor-B isoform and upregulation of the progesterone receptor-A isoform, resulting in an imbalance in the native ratio of progesterone receptor A and B isoforms. MTA1 transgene also increased the expression of progesterone receptor-A target genes Bcl-X-L (Bcl2l1) and cyclin D1 in mammary gland of virgin mice, and, subsequently, produced a delayed involution.

The advantage of generating such hybrid cells is that the entire cellular material of the tumor is processed and presented in both endogenous and exogenous pathways. This leads to activation of both MHC class I restricted CD8 cells as well as MHC class II restricted CD4 T cells. Here, we examined in vitro T cell stimulatory capacity of autologous human DC-glioma fusion in comparison to DC loaded with apoptotic glioma. DC fused with autologous tumor or loaded with apoptotic tumor cells (DC/apo) were first used to stimulate autologous non-adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), in vitro. The PBMC were then examined for phenotype (CD3, CD4, CD8) and intracellular IFN-gamma using flow cytometry. Lymphocyte proliferation and cytolytic responses were also assessed. Lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with fusion or DC/apo cells showed significantly enhanced cytotoxicity and proliferation against autologous tumor cells compared with PBMC stimulated with tumor cells or DC alone. Both strategies had similar efficacy. Tumor-cytolytic responses were enhanced by the addition of CD40 ligand (CD40L), and partially blocked by anti-MHC class I antibody. Flow cytometric analysis detected CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells, which also stained positive for intracellular IFN-gamma. The study suggests that DC/glioma fusion and DC/apo have comparable efficacy for stimulation of CTL with cytolytic and proliferative activity against human malignant gliomas. These findings may have implications for future studies of DC-based immunotherapy in malignant gliomas.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0167-594X,,,NA,NA,AUG-SEP,2003,64,1,,,,,177,183,,10.1007/BF02700032,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000184471100019,12952298,44,J,"Kugler, A; Stuhler, G; Walden, P; Zoller, G; Zobywalski, A; Brossart, P; Trefzer, U; Ullrich, S; Muller, CA; Becker, V; Gross, AJ; Hemmerlein, B; Kanz, L; Muller, GA; Ringert, RH",NA,,NA,"Kugler, A; Stuhler, G; Walden, P; Zoller, G; Zobywalski, A; Brossart, P; Trefzer, U; Ullrich, S; Muller, CA; Becker, V; Gross, AJ; Hemmerlein, B; Kanz, L; Muller, GA; Ringert, RH",NA,,"Regression of human metastatic renal cell carcinoma after vaccination with tumor cell-dendritic cell hybrids (Retraction of vol 6, pg 332, 2000)",NATURE MEDICINE,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1078-8956,,,NA,NA,SEP,2003,9,9,,NA,,NA,1221,1221,,,,NA,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine,NA,WOS:000185061600037,12949529,NA,2000,"Kugler, A"," Stuhler, G"," Walden, P"," Zoller, G"," Zobywalski, A"," Brossart, P"," Trefzer, U"," Ullrich, S"," Muller, CA"," Becker, V"," Gross, AJ"," Hemmerlein, B"," Kanz, L"," Muller, GA"," Ringert, RH",,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Kugler, A; Stuhler, G; Walden, P; Zoller, G; Zobywalski, A; Brossart, P; Trefzer, U; Ullrich, S; Muller, CA; Becker, V; Gross, AJ; Hemmerlein, B; Kanz, L; Muller, GA; Ringert, RH",NA,,NA,"Kugler, A; Stuhler, G; Walden, P; Zoller, G; Zobywalski, A; Brossart, P; Trefzer, U; Ullrich, S; Muller, CA; Becker, V; Gross, AJ; Hemmerlein, B; Kanz, L; Muller, GA; Ringert, RH",NA,,"Regression of human metastatic renal cell carcinoma after vaccination with tumor cell-dendritic cell hybrids (Retracted article.

This prospective study evaluates the medium-term clinical effects of an injectable silicone biomaterial, PTP(TM) (Bioplastique), used to augment the internal anal sphincter. METHOD: Eighty-two patients (64 females; median age, 66 years) with severe fecal incontinence and a low anal resting pressure caused by internal anal sphincter dysfunction (defect, n = 11; intact, n = 71) were randomized to PTP(TM) injection into intersphincteric space and internal anal sphincter with (Group A, n = 42) or without (Group B, n = 40) guidance by endoanal ultrasound. Both groups were similar in terms of age, gender, past anorectal surgery, duration of follow-up (median, 6 months; range, 1-12 months), and baseline continence score. Sixty-two percent of Group A and 55 percent of Group B had prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency. RESULTS: There was no significant complication. Two patients in Group A and four patients in Group B noted minor discomfort at injection sites. At one month postprocedure, endoanal ultrasound confirmed retention of silicone biomaterial without migration. In both groups, fecal continence was significantly improved by PTP(TM) implants I month after injection, but continued to improve significantly for up to 12 months in Group A and 6 months in Group B (P < 0.001). Improvement in fecal continence and maximum anal resting pressure was significantly greater in Group A, in whom injection was guided by endoanal ultrasound, than in Group B. At three months after injection, significantly more Group A patients than Group B patients achieved >50 percent improvement in Wexner's continence score (69 percent vs. 40 percent; P = 0.014). Ninety-three percent of Group A and 92 percent of Group B had >50 percent improvement in global quality of life scores (visual analog scale). At a median follow-up of 6 months, all domains of the fecal incontinence quality of life scale improved significantly in both groups; however, the physical function and mental health scores of Short Form-12 only improved in Group A.

Conservative measures may help some patients but there is no simple surgical solution for those who fail conservative treatment. A successful technique using trans-sphincteric injection of a bulking agent to augment the internal anal sphincter was developed in a previous pilot study. Aim: To determine the clinical results and underlying physiological effects of biomaterial injection. Patients: Six patients (four males, median age 53 years (range 36-65)) with faecal incontinence to solid or liquid stool related to poor internal anal sphincter function, of varied aetiology, were recruited. Methods: Silicone based biomaterial injections were performed, under local anaesthesia, with antibiotic cover. Three injections were placed circumferentially, trans-sphincterically, entering away from the anal margin and injecting at or just above the dentate line. Anorectal physiological studies, endoanal ultrasound, a bowel symptom diary, a validated incontinence score, and quality of life questionnaires were completed before treatment and on completion of follow up. Results: At a median follow up of 18 months (range 15-19), five of six patients had marked symptom. improvement. Faecal incontinence scores improved from a median of 14/24 (range 11-20) before to 8/24 (6-15) after injection. Short form-36 quality of life physical and social function scores improved from a median of 26/100 (5-33) to 79/100 (25-100) and from 10/100 (5-37) to 100/100 (50100), respectively. There was a corresponding physiological increase in maximum anal resting and squeeze pressures. Ultrasound showed the Bioplastique to be retained in the correct position in the improved patients without migration. There were no complications.

Autologous peripheral-blood progenitor cells can restore hematopoiesis after high-dose chemotherapy in patients with solid tumors or hematologic cancers. We investigated the ability of peripheral-blood progenitor cells generated ex vivo to restore hematopoiesis in patients with cancer who have undergone high-dose chemotherapy. Methods. Ten patients who had received high-dose chemotherapy were given transplants of autologous progenitor cells that had been generated ex vivo. We used 11 million CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells as the starting population for the cell growth. This number corresponds to less than 10 percent of the usual preparation of peripheral-blood CD34+ mononuclear cells used in leukapheresis. The CD34+ cells were grown in medium containing autologous plasma, recombinant human stem-cell factor, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-3, interleukin-6, and erythropoietin. Results. No toxic effects were observed with the infusion of the generated cells. The cells promoted a rapid and sustained hematopoietic recovery when transplanted after treatment with high-dose etoposide (1500 mg per square meter of body-surface area), ifosfamide (12 g per square meter), carboplatin (750 mg per square meter), and epirubicin (150 mg per square meter), The pattern of hematopoietic reconstitution was identical to that in historical controls treated with unseparated mononuclear cells or positively selected CD34+ cells. Conclusions. A small number of peripheral-blood CD34+ cells, when grown ex vivo, can supply a population of hematopoietic precursors that have the ability to restore blood formation in patients treated with high doses of chemotherapy. This method, which requires only a small volume of the patient's blood, may reduce the risk of tumor-cell contamination, circumvent the need for leukapheresis, and allow repeated cycles of high-dose chemotherapy.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-4793,,,NA,NA,03-Aug,1995,333,5,,,,NA,283,287,,10.1056/NEJM199508033330503,NA,NA,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,NA,WOS:A1995RL69400003,7541111,491,1,"Retraction: Reconstitution of hematopoiesis after high-dose chemotherapy by autologous progenitor cells generated ex vivo.

A grid-side energy storage system is considered to deliver smooth power to the system. Stable control strategies under the line fault condition are also discussed in this paper. The surplus power of the smart houses is sent back to the power grid, and a house owner can benefit by selling the extra power to the power company.

Silencing through epigenetics has been extensively studied; however, it is essential to understand how active rRNA genes are maintained. Here, we propose a role for the methyl-CpG binding domain protein MBD3 in epigenetically maintaining active rRNA promoters. We show that MBD3 is localized to the nucleolus, colocalizes with upstream binding factor, and binds to unmethylated rRNA promoters. Knockdown of MBD3 by small interfering RNA results in increased methylation of the rRNA promoter coupled with a decrease in RNA polymerase I binding and pre-rRNA transcription. Conversely, overexpression of MBD3 results in decreased methylation of the rRNA promoter.

A combination of cis elements, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are involved in the regulation of Oct4 gene expression. Here we show that the orphan nuclear receptor GCNF initiates Oct4 repression and DNA methylation by the differential recruitment of MBD (methylated CpG binding domain) factors to the promoter. Compared with wild-type ES cells and gastrulating embryos, Oct4 repression is lost and its proximal promoter is significantly hypomethylated in RA-differentiated GCNF(-/-) ES cells. The Oct4 gene is reexpressed in some somatic cells of GCNF(-/-) embryos, showing that it has not been properly silenced coincident with reduced DNA methylation of its promoter. Efforts to characterize mediators of GCNF's repressive function and DNA methylation of the Oct4 promoter identified methyl-DNA binding proteins, MBD3 and MBD2, as GCNF-interacting factors. In P19 and ES cells, upon differentiation, endogenous GCNF binds to the Oct4 proximal promoter and differentially recruits MBD3 and MBD2. In differentiated GCNF(-/-) ES cells, recruitment of MBD3 and MBD2 to the Oct4 promoter is lost, and repression of Oct4 expression and DNA methylation fails to occur. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of MBD3 and/or MBD2 expression results in reduced Oct4 repression in differentiated P19 and ES cells. Repression of Oct4 expression and recruitment of MBD3 are maintained in de novo DNA methylation-deficient ES cells (Dnmt3A/3B-null cells), while MBD2 recruitment is lost. Thus, recruitment of MBD3 and MBD2 by GCNF links two events, gene-specific repression and DNA methylation, which occur differentially at the Oct4 promoter.

The basally expressed TLR3 are functional in PTC cells as evidenced by the ability of double-strand RNA ( polyinosine-polycytidylic acid) to significantly increase the activity of transfected NF-kappa B and IFN-beta luciferase reporter genes and the levels of two end products of TLR3 signaling, IFN-beta and CXCL10. Phenylmethimazole ( C10), a drug that decreases TLR3 expression and signaling in FRTL-5 thyrocytes, decreases TLR3 levels and signaling in PTC cells in a concentration-dependent manner.

Cells were isolated from liposuction material, expanded and subjected to chondrogenic differentiation. Micromass pellets were cultured in chondrogenic medium containing 10 ng/mL TGF-beta 3 which was additionally supplemented with 10 ng/mL BMP-6, 10 ng/mL FGF-2 or a combination of both. We quantitatively evaluated the cartilage specific gene expression after 14 days of culture. The end point measurements on day 35 included glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, histological staining for chondrogenic markers, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In comparison to cultures induced with TGF-beta 3/FGF-2, the presence of TGF-beta 3/BMP-6 demonstrated strong induction of collagen type II, collagen type IX and aggrecan mRNA expression. This was corroborated by quantification and histological staining for GAGs and immunohistological staining for collagen II. However, when a combination of BMP-6 and FGF-2 in addition to TGF-beta 3 was added, FGF-2 counteracted BMP-6, as indicated by reduced marker gene expression and weak to absent staining for GAGs. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that BMP-6 combined with TGF-beta 3 is a potent inducer of chondrogenesis in human ASC. In contrast, FGF-2 does not contribute to differentiation, but rather suppresses the chondrogenic potential of BMP-6. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Estrogen targets all of the major hypothalamic neuroendocrine and autonomic cellular groups to activate multiple signaling pathways. Originally it was thought that all of these actions of estrogen could be ascribed to its binding to its ""classical"" intracellular receptor and to alterations in gene transcription. However, we now know that this steroid hormone activates multiple signaling pathways to affect neuronal excitability and gene transcription. Although the ""classical"" genomic signaling pathway has been recognized for almost half a century, until recently little attention has been paid to the rapid membrane-initiated signaling by estrogen in neurons. It has been known since the 1970s that estrogen can rapidly alter neuronal firing within seconds, indicating that some cellular effects of estrogen could occur via rapid, nontranscriptional mechanisms. Therefore, this chapter reviews the current status of estrogen signaling in the hypothalamus via membrane-initiated and nuclear-mediated events that affect the excitability of hypothalamic neurons and, ultimately, neuroendocrine and autonomic functions.

The effects of menopause transition on metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk in women are unclear. It is unknown whether estrogen deficiency, aging, or a combination of both factors are independent contributors to a worsening health profile in women. We considered the effects of menopause transition and hormone replacement therapy on body composition, regional body fat, energy expenditure, and insulin sensitivity. Methods. A brief review of current literature that has considered the role of menopause transition and hormone replacement therapy on body composition, energy expenditure, and insulin sensitivity with an emphasis on longitudinal investigations. Results. Preliminary evidence suggests that natural menopause is associated with reduced energy expenditure during rest and physical activity, an accelerated loss of fat-free mass, and increased central adiposity and fasting insulin levels. Hormone replacement therapy has been shown to attenuate these changes. Longitudinal and longer intervention studies are needed to confirm these initial findings. Conclusions. Menopause transition may represent a risky period in a woman's life, 'triggering' adverse metabolic and cardiovascular processes that predispose women to a greater incidence of obesity-related comorbidities. Dietary, exercise, and hormonal interventions specifically targeted at premenopausal women may help mitigate the worsening cardiovascular and metabolic risk profile associated with menopause.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0001-6349,1600-0412,,NA,NA,JUL,2002,81,7,,,,NA,603,611,,10.1034/j.1600-0412.2002.810705.x,NA,NA,Obstetrics & Gynecology,Obstetrics & Gynecology,NA,WOS:000176905700005,12190834,463,1,"Menopause, energy expenditure, and body composition (Retraction of vol 81, pg 603, 2002)",1,"menopause, energy expenditure, and body composition","menopause, energy expenditure, and body composition",TRUE,2005 (Book),17-Oct-05,18-Jul-02,2005,2005,2002

Self-organisation of the soluble electron-accepting perylene derivative and the soluble liquid crystalline (LC) discotic material which is stable in a LC phase at room temperature (HBC-PhC12) leads to segregated structures optimised for charge separation and transport in photovoltaic device structures. High external quantum efficiencies up to 34% near 490 nm have been reached. The high efficiencies result from efficient photo-induced charge transfer between the materials as well as effective transport of electrons and holes to the cathode and anode through segregated perylene and the discotic peri-hexabenzocoronene p-system. Atomic force microscopy and device characteristics suggest that the driving force for phase separation and surface energy effects during spin coating of the HBC-PhC12:perylene blend result in a spontaneous vertical segregation of the HBC and the perylene normal to the plane of the spun film. This represents a nearly ideal, self-organised structure in which vertical segregation of charge transport layers coexist with a high interfacial area between the two charge transfer components. This vertical segregation has not been observed in the spin-coated blends where the HBC-PhC12 is replaced by HBC-C-8(*). One probable reason for this may be the different phase stability of the LC phase in the HBCs, which leads to different film-forming properties and film morphologies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

One of the striking characteristics of this brain region is the abundance of nerve cells (neurons) expressing a great numbers of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, among which are hormones released into the blood stream through brain neuroendocrinological routes. The neurons in the lateral hypothalamus take part in intra- and extrahypothalamic circuits controlling basic physiological functions essential for the well being of animal bodies (such as cardiovascular function, respiratory function, immune responses, etc.), animal behaviors required for the maintenance of the survival of individuals (food foraging, flight, fight, etc.) and species (reproductive function), and higher brain functions (learning and memory, mental state, etc.). Hypocretin (also called orexin) comprises of two neuropeptides exclusively synthesized by neurons in the perifornical/lateral hypothalamus. Although hypocretin/orexin was initially found to enhance food intake, it is now clear that the functions mediated by hypocretin/orexin are well beyond what were originally proposed. Specifically, hypocretin/orexin is a crucial promoter of wakefulness; deficiency in the hypocretin/orexin system leads to diseases and disorders such as narcolepsy. It is clear that neurons synthesizing hypocretin/orexin are consistently under regulation originating from various parts of the brain and that the status of activity in hypocretin/orexin neurons is closely related with the nutritional and behavioral state of animals. Therefore, the demand to make adaptive changes in hypocretin/orexin neurons to accommodate the changes in the external environment and behavioral state of animals is expected. The latest developments in the studies of plasticity in hypocretin/orexin neurons under the challenges from environmental and behavioral factors have dramatically shaped the understanding of the roles of hypocretin/orexin neurons in the maintenance of the survival of animals. More importantly, the studies of plasticity in hypocretin/ orexin neurons as the consequence of physiological, behavioral, and environmental challenges may shed new insight on the understanding and treatment of sleep disorders (such as insomnia).

Therefore, we examined the effect of DA on the excitatory neurotransmission to orexin neurons. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed using acute rat hypothalamic slices, and orexin neurons were identified by their electrophysiological and immunohistochemical characteristics. Pharmacologically isolated action potential-independent miniatures EPSCs (mEPSCs) were monitored. Bath application of DA induced a bidirectional effect on the excitatory synaptic transmission dose dependently. A low dose of DA (1 mu M) increased mEPSC frequency, which was blocked by the D-1-like receptor antagonist SCH 23390, and mimicked by the D-1-like receptor agonist SKF 81297. In contrast, higher doses of DA (10-100 mu M) decreased mEPSC frequency, which could be blocked with the D-2-like receptor antagonist, sulpiride. Quinpirole, the D-2-like receptor agonist, also reduced mEPSC frequency. None of these compounds affected the mEPSCs amplitude, suggesting the locus of action was presynaptic. Furthermore, DA (1 mu M) induced an increase in the action potential firing, whereas DA (100 mu M) hyperpolarized and ceased the firing of orexin neurons, indicating the effect of DA on excitatory synaptic transmission may influence the activity of the postsynaptic cell.

Furthermore, APC significantly inhibited the IIR-induced decrease in renal tissue blood flow and the increase in the vascular permeability, whereas neither DEGR-FXa, heparin, nor DIP-APC produced such effects. Renal IIR-induced increases in plasma levels of fibrin degradation products were significantly inhibited by APC, DEGR-FXa, and heparin, These observations suggest that APC reduces IIR-induced renal injury independently of its anticoagulant effects but in a manner dependent on its serine protease activity. Renal levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), rat interleukin-8, and myeloperoxidase were significantly increased after renal I/R, These increases were significantly inhibited by APC but not by DEGR-FXa, heparin, or DIP-APC.

Detection of tumor-specific genetic materials in cancer patients at sites distant from the tumor, such as in the blood, may provide a unique and valuable tumor marker for diagnosis and prognosis. Experimental Design: The present investigation was aimed at determining the presence of p53 mutations in the peripheral blood of breast cancer patients and its prognostic value in these patients. Results: In this study, we found that the mean concentration of plasma DNA in healthy women was 21 ng/ml, whereas in patients with breast cancer the mean concentration was 211 ng/ml (P < 0.01). p53 mutations were detected in the primary tumors of 46 of 126 (36.5%) breast cancer patients. Of these 46 patients, 30 (65.1 %) were found to have p53 mutations in their plasma DNA. p53 mutations in plasma DNA were strongly correlated with clinical stage, tumor size, lymph node (LN) metastasis, and estrogen receptor status (P < 0.05). After a median follow-up of 29 months, univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that both primary tumor and plasma DNA p53 mutations were significant prognostic factors for both relapse-free and overall survival. Furthermore, we demonstrated that patients with both primary tumor and plasma p53 mutations have the worst survival. This outcome occurs in both LN-positive and LN-negative groups. Thirteen of the 22 (59%) patients with recurrence and/or metastasis later had detectable p53 mutations in their plasma DNA.

An effective subunit vaccine must traffic to lymph nodes (LNs), activate both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, and persist for a sufficient time to promote a mature immune response. Here, we review approaches to tailor these three aspects of vaccine function through optimized formulations. Traditional vaccine adjuvants activate innate immune cells, promote cell-mediated transport of antigen to lymphoid tissues, and promote antigen retention in LNs. Recent studies using nanoparticles and other lymphatic-targeting strategies suggest that direct targeting of antigens and adjuvant compounds to LNs can also enhance vaccine potency without sacrificing safety. The use of formulations to regulate biodistribution and promote antigen and inflammatory cue co-uptake in immune cells may be important for next-generation molecular adjuvants. Finally, strategies to program vaccine kinetics through novel formulation and delivery strategies provide another means to enhance immune responses independent of the choice of adjuvant.

To test the hypothesis that GRP mediates asthma, we used two murine models: ozone exposure for air pollution-induced airway hyperreactivity (AHR), and ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway disease. BALB/c mice were given small molecule GRP blocking agent 77427, or GRP blocking antibody 2A11, before exposure to ozone or OVA challenge. In both models, GRP blockade abrogated AHR and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) macrophages and granulocytes, and decreased BAL cytokines implicated in asthma, including those typically derived from Th1 (e.g., IL-2, TNF alpha), Th2 (e g., IL-5, IL-13), Th17 (IL-17), macrophages (e. g., MCP-1, IL-1), and neutrophils (KC = IL-8).

Absence of a functional VDR or the key activating enzyme, 25-OHD-1 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), in mice creates a bone and growth plate phenotype that mimics humans with the same congenital disease or severe vitamin D deficiency. The intestine is the key target for the VDR because high calcium intake, or selective VDR rescue in the intestine, restores a normal bone and growth plate phenotype. The VDR is nearly ubiquitously expressed, and almost all cells respond to 1,25-(OH)(2)D exposure; about 3% of the mouse or human genome is regulated, directly and/or indirectly, by the vitamin D endocrine system, suggesting a more widespread function. VDR-deficient mice, but not vitamin D- or 1 alpha-hydroxylase-deficient mice, and man develop total alopecia, indicating that the function of the VDR and its ligand is not fully overlapping. The immune system of VDR- or vitamin D- deficient mice is grossly normal but shows increased sensitivity to autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or type 1 diabetes after exposure to predisposing factors. VDR- deficient mice do not have a spontaneous increase in cancer but are more prone to oncogene- or chemocarcinogen-induced tumors. They also develop high renin hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and increased thrombogenicity. Vitamin D deficiency in humans is associated with increased prevalence of diseases, as predicted by the VDR null phenotype. Prospective vitamin D supplementation studies with multiple noncalcemic endpoints are needed to define the benefits of an optimal vitamin D status.

The mapped negative vitamin D response element (1alphanVDRE) in the human 1alpha(OH)ase gene promoter (around 530 bp) was distinct from those of the reported DR3-like nVDREs, composed of two E-box-like motifs. Unlike the reported nVDREs, no direct binding of VDR/RXR heterodimer to 1alphanVDRE was detected. A bHLH-type factor, designated VDIR, was identified as a direct sequence-specific activator of 1alphanVDRE. The transactivation function of VDIR was further potentiated by activated-PKA signaling through phosphorylation of serine residues in the transactivation domains, with the recruitment of a p300 histone acetyltransferase co-activator. The ligand-dependent association of VDR/RXR heterodimer with VDIR bound to 1alphanVDRE caused the dissociation of p300 co-activators from VDIR, and the association of HDAC co-repressor complex components resulting in ligand-induced transrepression.

Recent works suggest that topological parameters, amino acid properties, chain length and the composition index relate well with protein folding rates, however, sequence order information has seldom been considered as a property for predicting protein folding rates. In this study, amino acid sequence order was used to derive an effective method, based on an extended version of the pseudo-amino acid composition, for predicting protein folding rates without any explicit structural information. Using the jackknife cross validation test, the method was demonstrated on the largest dataset (99 proteins) reported. The method was found to provide a good correlation between the predicted and experimental folding rates. The correlation coefficient is 0.81 (with a highly significant level) and the standard error is 2.46. The reported algorithm was found to perform better than several representative sequence-based approaches using the same dataset.

We present a method for high-resolution vertical temperature profiling in surface-water sediments for detailed quantification of seepage flux over depth and time. The method is based on fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing, in which temperature profiles along an optical fiber are obtained by making use of Raman scattering. An optical fiber was wrapped around a 2 in. PVC tube and installed vertically within the streambed sediment. The wrapping transfers the spatial resolution along the fiber of I no to a vertical resolution of about 5 mm. The high-resolution temperature profiler was tested at a losing reach of the Swiss prealpine River Thur resulting in a 20-day long temperature time series with a temporal resolution of 10 min. The time series are analyzed by means of dynamic harmonic regression to obtain the diurnal contributions of the measured time series at all depths and time points. The time for the diurnal temperature signal to reach the observation depth and the associated attenuation of the signal are calculated from the phase angles and amplitudes of the diurnal contributions. The time shift results in an apparent celerity of diurnal temperature propagation, which is converted into an apparent seepage rate by fitting the data to the analytical solution for convective-conductive heat transfer in a semi-infinite, uniform, one-dimensional domain with a sinusoidal surface temperature. The high spatial resolution allows the location of discontinuities in the river bed which would have remained undetected if temperature had been measured only at a few individual depths to be identified. This is a particular strength of the fiber-optic high-resolution temperature profiler. The time series also give evidence of sporadic high infiltration rates at times of high water tables.

Differentiation of these cells from naive T cells occurs primarily via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Targeting this pathway through inhibition of activating cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) and their receptors, the JAKs or the STATs, has been shown to have a therapeutic effect on asthma pathology.

Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is elevated in the UC mucosa and may induce dysregulated signaling in neighboring intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and thus function as a tumorogenic cytokine. Methods: Expression of IL-13 receptor chains on IECs obtained from control or chronically inflamed mucosa and colonic tumors was quantified by flow cytometry and immunoblot. IL-13R alpha 1 and IL-13R alpha 2 expression was significantly increased on IEC from UC and CRC patients compared to control and Crohn's disease (CD) subjects. Purified IEC from these subjects and cell lines expressing varying ratios of IL-13R alpha 1 and IL-3R alpha 2 chains were stimulated with IL-13 in vitro to investigate by immunoblot the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Results: Despite similarly elevated receptor expression in UC and CRC, IL-13 does not activate the STAT6 or MAPK pathways in UC, while in colonic tumors only the STAT6 pathway is activated. Using neutralizing antibodies and cell lines expressing a range of surface densities for IL-13R alpha 1 and IL-3R alpha 2, we demonstrate that IL-13R alpha 2 serves a dual role, initiating MAPK signaling at low concentrations and as an inhibitory, decoy receptor at high IL-13R alpha 2 to IL-13R alpha 1 ratios. Conclusions: IL-13R alpha 2 is both a decoy receptor and induces MAPK signal transduction, depending on its relative expression and the local concentration of IL-13, which together modulate the balance and intensity of the signaling pathways initiated in UC and CRC.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1078-0998,1536-4844,,NA,NA,MAY,2010,16,5,,,,NA,753,764,,10.1002/ibd.21133,NA,NA,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,NA,WOS:000277385200011,20014020,938,1,"Elevated IL-13R alpha 2 in Intestinal Epithelial Cells From Ulcerative Colitis or Colorectal Cancer Initiates MAPK Pathway (Retraction of vol 16, pg 753, 2010)",1,elevated il-13r alpha 2 in intestinal epithelial cells from ulcerative colitis or colorectal cancer initiates mapk pathway,elevated il-13r alpha 2 in intestinal epithelial cells from ulcerative colitis or colorectal cancer initiates mapk pathway,TRUE,2016,01-Jul-15,01-May-10,2016,2015,2010

Role of the junctional epithelium in periodontal innate defense and homeostasis. J Periodont Res 2012; 47: 750757. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S Background and Objective: The junctional epithelium provides the front-line defense against periodontal bacterial infection. The migration of neutrophils into the junctional epithelium might represent a protective reaction against bacterial infections. However, neutrophils penetrate into the junctional epithelium even under sterile conditions. In this study, we analyzed and compared the number of neutrophils and the cytokine expression related to neutrophil migration in the junctional epithelium in conventional and germ-free mice. Material and Methods: Germ-free and conventional ICR mice were used at 12 wk of age. Frozen sections were used for the detection of Gr-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2/CXCL2) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells in the two groups of mice. Laser capture microdissection and RT-PCR analysis were used to evaluate the expression of keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC/CXCL1), MIP-2, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) mRNAs in the two groups of mice. Results: Morphometric examination indicated an increase in the area of the junctional epithelium upon bacterial infection. Immunohistochemical studies also detected an increased number of neutrophils in the junctional epithelium upon bacterial infection. Higher up-regulation of KC and MIP-2 were detected in the junctional epithelium of conventional mice than in germ-free mice, whereas the expression of Il-1 beta and Tnfa mRNAs was not affected. Conclusion: Junctional epithelium cells constitutively expressed several types of chemokines and cytokines and the expression of chemokines was augmented by bacterial infection. Therefore, the constitutive expression of cytokines in junctional epithelium might be related to the morphological and functional homeostasis of the junctional epithelium in addition to the defense against the bacterial infection.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0022-3484,,,NA,NA,DEC,2012,47,6,,,,,750,757,,10.1111/j.1600-0765.2012.01490.x,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000309600600009,22587460,3268,J,"Sugawara, S; Muramoto, K",NA,,NA,"Sugawara, Shunji; Muramoto, Koji",NA,,"Activation of Human Oral Epithelial Cells by Neutrophil Proteinase 3 Through Protease-Activated Receptor-2 (Retraction of vol 169, pg 4594, 2002)",JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0022-1767,,,NA,NA,01-Apr,2010,184,7,,NA,,NA,4042,4042,,10.4049/jimmunol.1090011,,NA,Immunology,Immunology,NA,WOS:000275927600083,20304833,NA,2002,"Sugawara, S"," Muramoto, K",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Uehara, A; Sugawara, S; Muramoto, K; Takada, H",NA,,NA,"Uehara, A; Sugawara, S; Muramoto, K; Takada, H",NA,,Activation of human oral epithelial cells by neutrophil proteinase 3 through protease-activated receptor-2,JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,"Proteinase 3 (PR3), a 29-kDa serine proteinase secreted from activated neutrophils, also exists in a membrane-bound form, and is suggested to actively contribute to inflammatory processes. The present study focused on the mechanism by which PR3 activates human oral epithelial cells. PR3 activated the epithelial cells in culture to produce IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and to express ICAM-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Incubation of the epithelial cells for 24 h with PR3 resulted in a significant increase in the adhesion to neutrophils, which was reduced to baseline levels in the presence of anti-ICAM-1 mAb. Activation of the epithelial cells by PR3 was inhibited by serine proteinase inhibitors and serum. The epithelial cells strongly express protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 and PAR-2 mRNA and weakly express PAR-3 mRNA. The expression of PAR-2 on the cell surface was promoted by PR3, and inhibited by cytochalasin B, but not by cycloheximide. PR3 cleaved the peptide corresponding to the N terminus of PAR-2 with exposure of its tethered ligand. Treatment with trypsin, an agonist for PAR-2, and a synthetic PAR-2 agonist peptide induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and rendered cells refractory to subsequent stimulation with PR3 and vice versa. The production of cytokine induced by PR3 and the PAR-2 agonist peptide was completely abolished by a phospholipase C inhibitor.

In this study, the methylation status of the LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposon promoter was analysed in CML samples from the chronic-phase (CP, n = 140) and the blast crisis (BC, n = 47). L1 hypomethylation was significantly more frequent in BC (74.5%) than in CP (38%) (P < 0.0001).

In the present work, we found that WM resolution exhibited monotonic declines until set size reached three items, after which resolution achieved a clear asymptote. Moreover, analyses of individual differences showed a strong correlation between each observer's item limit and the set size at which WM resolution achieved asymptote. These behavioral observations were corroborated by measurements of contralateral delay activity (CDA), an event-related potential waveform that tracks the number of items maintained during the delay period. CDA activity rose monotonically and achieved asymptote at a set size that predicted individual WM capacity.

Apoptosis of pulmonary or extrapulmonary cells has been observed in COPD and has been shown to contribute to the initiation and progression of COPD. The interactions of apoptosis and other mechanisms, such as inflammation, proteolytic/antiproteolytic imbalance, oxidative stress and so on, also have been described in COPD pathogenesis. The Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis via mitochondrial maintenance. These proteins consist of anti- and pro-apoptotic members, and interactions of them decide whether the mitochondria should initiate the programmed death by releasing proapoptotic factors. The anti-apoptotic proteins have been reported to present protective potential for COPD, whereas the pro-apoptotic proteins have been described to contribute to COPD. Design: This review highlights the participation of apoptosis, particularly those related to deregulation of Bcl-2 family proteins in COPD. We searched key words, such as ""apoptosis"", ""COPD"", ""Bcl-2"", ""cigarette smoke"" and ""alveolar cells"", by Pubmed engine. Results: There has been a strong progress in apoptotic processes. However, there are still considerable gaps in knowledge regarding this specific process causing alveolar destruction.

However, Nrf2 also regulates the proteasome system that degrades damaged and misfolded proteins. Because accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes ER stress and ER stress-induced apoptosis, Nrf2 may potentially prevent ER stress-mediated apoptosis in COPD. Objectives: To determine whether Nrf2-regulated proteasome function affects ER stress-mediated apoptosis in COPD. Methods: We assessed the expression of Nrf2, Nrf2-dependent proteasomal subunits, proteasomal activity, markers of ER stress, and apoptosis in emphysematous lungs of mice exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) as well as peripheral lung tissues from normal control subjects and patients with COPD. Measurements and Main Results: Compared with wild-type mice, emphysematous lungs of CS-exposed Nrf2-deficient mice exhibited markedly lower proteasomal activity and elevated markers of ER stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, compared with normal control subjects, lungs of patients with mild and advanced COPD showed a marked decrease in the expression of Nrf2-regulated proteasomal subunits and total proteasomal activity. However, they were associated with greater levels of ER stress and apoptosis markers. In vitro studies have demonstrated that enhancing proteasomal activity in Beas2B cells either by sulforaphane, an activator of Nrf2, or overexpression of Nrf2-regulated proteasomal subunit PSMB6, significantly inhibited cigarette smoke condensate (CSC)-induced ER stress and cell death. Conclusions: Impaired Nrf2 signaling causes significant decline in proteasomal activity and heightens ER stress response in lungs of patients with COPD and CS-exposed mice.

ABAP1 protein is a 472-amino acid polypeptide containing a WW protein interaction domain and is induced by ABA in barley aleurone layers. Polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies (AB2) cross-reacted with purified ABAP1 and with a corresponding 52-kDa protein associated with membrane fractions of ABA-treated barley aleurones. ABAP1 genes were detected in diverse monocot and dicot species, including wheat, tobacco, alfalfa, garden pea, and oilseed rape. The recombinant ABAP1 protein optimally bound (3)H-(+)-ABA at neutral pH. Denatured ABAP1 protein did not bind (3)H-(+)-ABA, nor did bovine serum albumin. The maximum specific binding as shown by Scatchard plot analysis was 0.8 mol of ABA mol(-1) protein with a linear function of r(2) = 0.94, an indication of one ABA-binding site with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 28 x 10(-9) M.

The similarities in the dissociation constants for ABA binding of the recombinant protein and that of the plasma membranes suggest that the protein within the plasma membrane fraction is the native form of ABAP1. The stereospecificity of ABAP1 was established by the incapability of ABA analogs and metabolites, including (-)-ABA, trans-ABA, phaseic acid, dihydrophaseic acid, and (+)-abscisic acid-glucose ester, to displace (3)H-(+)ABA bound to ABAP1. However, two ABA precursors, (+)-ABA aldehyde and (+)-ABA alcohol, were able to displace (3)H-(+)-ABA, an indication that the structural requirement of ABAP1 at the C-1 position is not strict.

Therefore, targeting systemic and local oxidative stress with antioxidants/redox modulating agents, or boosting the endogenous levels of antioxidants are likely to have beneficial effects in the treatment/management of COPD. Various antioxidant agents, such as thiol molecules (glutathione and mucolytic drugs, such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine and Nacystelyn, erdosteine, fudosteine, ergothioneine, and carbocysteine), have been reported to modulate various cellular and biochemical aspects of COPD. These antioxidants have been found to scavenge and detoxify free radicals and oxidants, regulate of glutathione biosynthesis, control nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, and hence inhibiting inflammatory gene expression. Synthetic molecules, such as specific spin traps like alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone, a catalytic antioxidant (ECSOD mimetic), porphyrins (AEOL 10150 and AEOL 10113), and a superoxide dismutase mimetic M40419, iNOS and myeloperoxidase inhibitors, lipid peroxidation inhibitors/blockers edaravone, and lazaroids/tirilazad have also been shown to have beneficial effects by inhibiting cigarette smoke-induced inflammatory responses and other carbonyl/oxidative stress-induced cellular alterations.

The progressive decline in lung function that occurs in COPD is a result of persistent inflammation of the airways and destruction of the lung parenchyma. Despite the key role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of COPD, treatment with corticosteroids - normally highly effective antiinflanunatory drugs - has little therapeutic benefit. This corticosteroid resistance is largely caused by inactivation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), which is critical for the transrepressive activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) that mediates the antiinflanunatory effect of corticosteroids. Here, we show that in alveolar macrophages from patients with COPD, S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 is increased and that this abolishes its GR-transrepression activity and promotes corticosteroid insensitivity. Cys-262 and Cys-274 of HDAC2 were found to be the targets of S-nitrosylation, and exogenous glutathione treatment of macrophages from individuals with COPD restored HDAC2 activity. Treatment with sulforaphane, a small-molecule activator of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), was also able to denitrosylate HDAC2, restoring dexamethasone sensitivity in alveolar macrophages from patients with COPD. These effects of sulforaphane were glutathione dependent.

It is shown that under homogeneous Neumann boundary condition the occurrence of space diffusion does not affect the stability of the positive constant equilibrium of the system. However, we find that the incorporation of a discrete delay representing the gestation of prey species can not only destabilize the positive constant equilibrium of the system but can also cause a Hopf bifurcation at the positive constant equilibrium as it crosses some critical values. In particular, we prove that these Hopf bifurcations' periodic solutions are all spatially homogeneous if the diffusive rates are suitably large, which has the same properties as periodic solutions of the corresponding delayed system without diffusion. However, if the diffusive rates are suitably small, then the system will generate spatially nonhomogeneous periodic solutions.

Highly prevalent coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB-77) accumulate in adipose tissue because of their lipophilicity and increase with obesity. However, the effects of PCBs on adipocytes, obesity, and obesity-associated cardiovascular disease are unknown. OBJECTIVES: In this study we examined in vitro and in vivo effects of PCB-77 on adipocyte differentiation, proinflammatory adipokines, adipocyte morphology, body weight, serum lipids, and atherosclerosis. METHODS: PCB-77 or 2,2',4,4,5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) was incubated with 3T3-L1 adipocytes either during differentiation or in mature adipocytes. Concentration-dependent effects of PCB-77 were contrasted with those of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). For in vivo studies, we treated C57BL/6 wild-type (NW) or aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)(-/-) mice with vehicle or PCB-77 (49 mg/kg, by intraperitoneal injection) and examined body weight gain. In separate studies, we injected ApoE(-/-) mice with vehicle or PCB-77 over a 6-week period and examined body weight, adipocyte size, serum lipids, and atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Low concentrations of PCB-77 or TCDD increased adipocyte differentiation, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, whereas higher concentrations inhibited adipocyte differentiation. Effects of PCB-77 were abolished by the AhR antagonist a-naphthoflavone. PCB-77 promoted the expression and release of various proinflammatory cytokines from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Administration of PCB-77 increased body weight gain in WT but not AhR(-/-) mice. ApoE(-/-) mice injected with PCB-77 exhibited greater body weight, adipocyte hypertrophy, serum dyslipidemia, and augmented atherosclerosis.

We have used the ubiquitous environmental and occupational neurotoxicant polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to investigate the putative role of inflammatory agents in mediating processes involved in basal ganglia dysfunctions. PCBs induced inflammatory responses in C57BL/6 adult male mice, significantly elevating serum levels of IL-6 (31%), IL-1 beta (71%) and TNF-alpha (22%) and significantly reducing striatal dopamine (DA, 21%), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, 26%), dopamine transporter (DAT, 39%), and synaptophysin (29%) concentrations. We also exposed mice deficient in the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6(-/-)) to PCBs, to explore the role of this specific cytokine in mediating PCB-induced DA neurodegeneration. Not only did the PCB-treated IL-6-/- mice exhibit a decrease in serum levels of IL-1 and TNF-alpha, but they were also protected from PCB-induced striatal dopaminergic dysfunction, displaying no signs of toxicant-induced reductions in DA levels, or TH, DAT or synaptophysin expression. Taken together, these results suggest that: (1) PC13 exposure results in a peripheral inflammatory response associated with striatal terminal degeneration; and (2) the absence of IL-6 prevents PCB-induced dopaminergic losses in the striatum.

Choline is predominantly absorbed from the small intestine and completely metabolized in the liver. We recently demonstrated that free choline (fCh) levels in blood reflect the level of phosphatidylcholine synthesis in the liver and is correlated with the onset of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Our aim here was to validate the utility of this biomarker for NASH diagnosis. Methods: Our cohort consisted of 110 patients with biopsy proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from four centers across Japan and 25 age-matched healthy controls. Plasma fCh levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: Patients with diagnosed or borderline NASH had significantly increased plasma fCh levels when compared with control subjects, or patients not diagnosed with NASH. Interestingly, an association between plasma fCh levels and expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which catalyzes the transfer of triglyceride, was reflected in the markedly negative correlation between these two variables in patients with NAFLD. Moreover, the grade of liver steatosis and fibrosis stage increased with increasing plasma fCh levels (P < 0.05). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves for NASH, including borderline diagnosis, was 0.811. Additionally, the areas under the ROC for fibrosis stage were 0.816 for >stage 1, 0.805 for >stage 2, 0.809 for >stage 3 and 0.818 for >stage 4.

All patients received intraarticular analgesics (bupivacaine, clonidine, and morphine) and had an external cooling system applied to the operative knee. After discharge, patients were instructed to take acetaminophen 1000 mg every 6 h and either celecoxib 200 mg every 12 h or matching placebo for the first 14 days postoperatively. Oxycodone 5-10 mg was available for rescue analgesia. RESULTS: Patients in the celecoxib group were more likely to experience less pain in the recovery room (P < 0.01) and require less opioids (P < 0.001) for postoperative analgesia. These patients reported a lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (P < 0.05) and were discharged home earlier (P < 0.05). While at home patients in the celecoxib group reported lower pain scores both at rest (P < 0.05) and with movement (P < 0.01), and used less oxycodone at all postoperative time intervals.

Thus, they can be administered to patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery without an added risk of bleeding. However, concerns regarding a possible deleterious effect on bone-healing have limited their routine use. Celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, recently was approved for the treatment of acute pain. The goals of the present study were to examine the analgesic efficacy of celecoxib and to determine the incidence of nonunion at one year following spinal fusion surgery. Methods: Eighty patients who were scheduled to undergo spinal fusion received either celecoxib or placebo one hour before the induction of anesthesia and every twelve hours after surgery for the first five postoperative days. Pain scores and morphine use were recorded one hour after arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit and at four, eight, twelve, sixteen, twenty, and twenty-four hours later. Intraoperative blood loss was recorded. The status of the fusion was determined radiographically at the time of the one-year follow-up. Results: There were no differences in demographic data or blood loss between the two groups. Pain scores were lower in the celecoxib group at one, four, eight, sixteen, and twenty hours postoperatively. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to the pain scores at twelve and twenty-four hours postoperatively. Morphine use was lower in the celecoxib group at all postoperative time-intervals. There was no difference between the celecoxib group and the placebo group with regard to the incidence of nonunion at the time of the one-year follow-up (7.5% [three of forty] compared with 10% [four of forty]). Conclusions: The perioperative administration of celecoxib resulted in a significant reduction in postoperative pain and opioid use following spinal fusion surgery. In addition, the short-term administration of this COX-2-specific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug had no apparent effect on the rate of nonunion at the time of the one-year follow-up.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0021-9355,1535-1386,,NA,NA,MAR,2005,87A,3,,,,NA,536,542,,10.2106/JBJS.D.02283,NA,NA,Orthopedics; Surgery,Orthopedics; Surgery,NA,WOS:000227617200009,15741619,2889,1,"The effect of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition on analgesia and spinal fusion (Retraction of vol 87, pg 536, 2005)",1,the effect of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition on analgesia and spinal fusion,the effect of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition on analgesia and spinal fusion,TRUE,Jul-07,01-Apr-09,Mar-05,2007,2009,2005

An understanding of the mass transfer mechanisms of drying would thus contribute to improving engineering design and the quality of the final product. In this work, a mathematical model for a cubic shape was proposed to predict the drying kinetics and moisture distribution during cheese drying. The model was developed taking into consideration both the external and internal resistances to mass transfer and an effective diffusion dependent on local moisture and temperature. Furthermore, a specific model for sorption isotherms was established from experimental results and used to complete the overall model formulation. The drying experiments were carried out at 6.3, 12.2, and 18.2 degrees C and 1.0 m s(-1) until a moisture content of approximately 0.30 kg kg(-1) (db) was reached. Moisture distribution was experimentally measured from the center of the cheese cube to the center of the surfaces and to the vertexes using a time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR) method. The proposed model was solved using a finite element method and validated by comparing the experimental moisture profiles with those simulated by the model.

E. coli O157:H7 strains have been shown to vary markedly in levels of protein secreted using the TTSS and this study has confirmed that a high secretion phenotype is more prevalent among isolates associated with human disease than isolates shed by healthy cattle. The variation in secretion levels is a consequence of heterogeneous expression, being dependent on the proportion of bacteria in a population that are actively engaged in protein secretion. This was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence and eGFP fusions that examined the expression of locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded factors in individual bacteria. In liquid media, the expression of EspA, tir::egfp, intimin, but not map::egfp were co-ordinated in a subpopulation of bacteria.

However, the incidence of disease in humans due to this pathogen is still very low. This study set out to investigate if there is a difference between strains isolated from human disease cases and those isolated from asymptomatic cattle which would account for the low disease incidence of such a ubiquitous organism. The work presented here has compared human disease strains from both sporadic and outbreak cases with a cross-section, as defined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, of E. coli O157 strains from cattle. Human (n = 22) and bovine (n = 31) strains were genotyped for carriage of the genes for Shiga-like toxin types 1, 2, and 2c; E. coli secreted protein genes espA, espB, and espP; the enterohemolysin gene; eae (intimin); ast (enteroaggregative E. coli stable toxin [EAST]); and genes for common E. coli adhesins. Strains were also phenotyped for hemolysin, EspP, Tir, and EspD expression as well as production of actin and cytoskeletal rearrangement associated with attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions on HeLa cells. The genotyping confirmed that there was little difference between the two groups, including carriage of stx(2) and stx(2c), which was similar in both sets. ast alleles were confirmed to all contain mutations that would prevent EAST expression. espP mutations were found only in cattle strains (5 of 30). Clear differences were observed in the expression of locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded factors between strains and in different media. EspD, as an indicator of LEE4 (espA, -B, and -D) expression, and Tir levels in supernatants were measured. Virtually all strains from both sources could produce EspD in Luria-Bertani broth, although at very different levels. Standard trichloroacetic acid precipitation of secreted proteins from tissue culture medium produced detectable levels of EspD from the majority of strains of human origin (15 of 20) compared with only a few (4 of 20) bovine strains (P < 0.001), which is indicative of much higher levels of protein secretion from the human strains. Addition of bovine serum albumin carrier protein before precipitation and enhanced detection techniques confirmed that EspD could be detected after growth in tissue culture medium for all strains, but levels from strains of human origin were on average 90-fold higher than those from strains of bovine origin. In general, levels of secretion also correlated with ability to form A/E lesions on HeLa cells, with only the high-level protein secretors in tissue culture medium exhibiting a localized adherence phenotype.

Numerous biomarkers have been studied as potential early predictors of the severity of this disease so that treatment can be optimally tailored to prevent complications. We aim to present and discuss the most relevant biomarkers for early severity assessment in AP that have been studied to date. We review the current literature on biomarkers that have been used to predict the severity in AP. C-reactive protein (CRP) is still considered to be the gold standard, with a cut-off value of 150 mg/ml 48 h after disease onset. Other markers, including procalcitonin (PCT) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) have been implemented in some hospitals, but are not used on a routine basis. Most other markers, including acute phase proteins (LBP, SAA, PTX3), cytokines (Il-8, TNF-a, MIF), activation peptides of pancreatic proteases (TAP, CAPAP, PLAP), antiproteases (AAT, a2M), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, selectins, E-cadherin) and leukocyte-derived enzymes (PA2, PMN-E) have shown some promising results but have not been routinely implemented. Furthermore, new and interesting biomarkers (Copeptin, TRX-1, Ang-2, E-2) have shown good results, but more research is needed to determine if they could play a role in the future.

During the past decade, there have been new understandings and developments in the diagnosis, etiology, and early and late management of the disease. As the diagnosis of AP is most often established by clinical symptoms and laboratory testing, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically. Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed. Patients with organ failure and/or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) should be admitted to an intensive care unit or intermediary care setting whenever possible. Aggressive hydration should be provided to all patients, unless cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidites preclude it. Early aggressive intravenous hydration is most beneficial within the first 12-24 h, and may have little benefit beyond. Patients with AP and concurrent acute cholangitis should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 24 h of admission. Pancreatic duct stents and/or postprocedure rectal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) suppositories should be utilized to lower the risk of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe AP and/or sterile necrosis is not recommended. In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis may be useful in delaying intervention, thus decreasing morbidity and mortality. In mild AP, oral feedings can be started immediately if there is no nausea and vomiting. In severe AP, enteral nutrition is recommended to prevent infectious complications, whereas parenteral nutrition should be avoided. Asymptomatic pancreatic and/or extrapancreatic necrosis and/or pseudocysts do not warrant intervention regardless of size, location, and/or extension.

These included: pandemic influenza vaccination, seasonal influenza vaccination, travel vaccines, human papilloma virus vaccine and childhood vaccinations. Analysis of the responses reveals three major attitude traits: (a) acceptance, characterized by the opinion that targets should be vaccinated; (b) individualism, characterized by the opinion that vaccination should be left to personal choice; and (c) differentiation, characterized by the tendency to express different attitudes when addressing different vaccination programs. Interestingly, direct opposition to vaccination was found to be a minor attitude trait in this survey. Groups within the population could be defined according to their tendency to assume these different attitudes as acceptors, judicious-acceptors, differentiators, soft-individualists, and hard-individualists. These groups expressed different standpoints on all five vaccination programs as well as on other health recommendations, such as screening for early detection of cancer. Attitude traits could be also correlated, to a certain extent, with actual compliance with vaccination programs. Interestingly, attitudes to vaccination were not correlated with social profiles related to income or education, although younger individuals exhibited higher degrees of individualism and differentiation.

Barium follow-through radiography was done where possible. Biochemical, haematological, and immunological profiles were examined. Findings Onset of behavioural symptoms was associated, by the parents, with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination in eight of the 12 children, with measles infection in one child, and otitis media in another. All 12 children had intestinal abnormalities, ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration. Histology showed patchy chronic inflammation in the colon in 11 children and reactive ileal lymphoid hyperplasia in seven, but no granulomas. Behavioural disorders included autism (nine), disintegrative psychosis (one), and possible postviral or vaccinal encephalitis (two).

Seminal studies in the early 1980 s about the angiogenic activity exerted by mammalian retinal tissue extracts on the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane and the later discovery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) accumulation in eyes of patients with diabetic retinopathy paved the way for the development of anti-angiogenic VEGF blockers for the treatment of retinal neovascularization. Since then, numerous preclinical and clinical studies about diabetic retinopathy and other retinal disorders have opened new lines of angiogenesis inquiry, indicating that limitations to anti-VEGF therapies may exist. Moreover, the production of growth factors other than VEGF may affect the response to anti-VEGF approaches. Thus, experimental models of retinal angiogenesis remain crucial for investigating novel anti-angiogenic therapies and bringing them to patients. To this aim, in vitro and ex vivo angiogenesis assays may be suitable for a rapid screening of potential anti-angiogenic molecules before in vivo validation of the putative lead compounds. This review focuses on the different in vitro and ex vivo angiogenesis assays that have been developed over the years based on the isolation of endothelial cells from the retina of various animal species and ex vivo cultures of neonatal and adult retina explants. Also, recent observations have shown that eye neovascularization in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, an in vivo animal platform experimentally analogous to in vitro/ex vivo models, may represent a novel target for the identification of angiogenesis inhibitors.

Developing efficient methods to control rice viruses is thus an urgent necessity because viruses cause serious losses in rice yield. Most rice viruses are transmitted by insect vectors, notably planthoppers and leafhoppers. Viruliferous insect vectors can disperse their viruses over relatively long distances, and eradication of the viruses is very difficult once they become widespread. Exploitation of natural genetic sources of resistance is one of the most effective approaches to protect crops from virus infection; however, only a few naturally occurring rice genes confer resistance against rice viruses. Many investigators are using genetic engineering of rice plants as a potential strategy to control viral diseases. Using viral genes to confer pathogen-derived resistance against crops is a well-established procedure, and the expression of various viral gene products has proved to be effective in preventing or reducing infection by various plant viruses since the 1990s. RNA interference (RNAi), also known as RNA silencing, is one of the most efficient methods to confer resistance against plant viruses on their respective crops. In this article, we review the recent progress, mainly conducted by our research group, in transgenic strategies to confer resistance against tenuiviruses and reoviruses in rice plants.

As systematic studies investigating potential anomalies in the morphology and anatomy of crop plants are scarce, herein we report on the developmental responses of two agriculturally significant crop plants, maize (Zea mays L) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L), upon in vitro exposure to nanoparticles of citrate-coated silver (Citrate-nAg) and zinc oxide (nZnO). Analyses involve histology of the primary root morphology and anatomy using light microscopy, metal biouptake, moisture content, rate of germination, and root elongation. Comparative toxicity profiles of the ionic salts (AgNO3 and ZnSO4) are developed. Notably, we uncover structural changes in maize primary root cells upon exposure to Citrate-nAg, nZnO, AgNO3, and ZnSO4, possibly due to metal biouptake, suggesting potential for functional impairments in the plant growth and development Citrate-nAg exposure results in lower Ag biouptake compared to AgNO3 treatment in maize. Microscopic evidence reveals 'tunneling-like effect' with nZnO treatment, while exposure to AgNO3 leads to cell erosion in maize root apical meristem. In maize, a significant change in metaxylem count is evident with Citrate-nAg, AgNO3, and ZnSO4 treatment, but not with nZnO treatment (p > 0.1). In both maize and cabbage, measures of germination and root elongation reveal lower nanoparticle toxicity compared to free ions. As moisture data do not support osmotically-induced water stress hypothesis for explaining toxicity, we discuss other proximate mechanisms including the potential role of growth hormones and transcription factors.

This study used complementary approaches of COX-2 transgenic (Tg) and knockout (KO) mouse models to evaluate the mechanism of COX-2 in Fas-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and liver failure in vivo. We generated Tg mice with targeted expression of COX-2 in the liver by using the albumin promoter-enhancer-driven vector. The COX-2 Tg, COX-2 KO, and wildtype mice were treated with the anti-Fas antibody Jo2 (0-5 mu g/g of body weight) for 4 to 6 hours, and the extent of liver injury was assessed by histopathology, serum aminotransferases, TUNEL staining, and caspase activation. The COX-2 Tg mice showed resistance to Fas-induced liver injury in comparison with the wild-type mice; this was reflected by the lower alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, less liver damage, and less hepatocyte apoptosis (P < 0.01). In contrast, the COX-2 KO mice showed significantly higher serum ALT and AST levels, more prominent hepatocyte apoptosis, and higher levels of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activity than the wild-type mice (P < 0.01). The COX-2 Tg livers expressed higher levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) than the wild-type controls; the COX-2 KO livers expressed the lowest levels of EGFR. Pretreatment with a COX-2 inhibitor (NS-398) or an EGFR inhibitor (AG1478) exacerbated Jo2-mediated liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis.

Transgenic mice, carrying the luciferase gene under the control of NF-kappa B, were constructed. In vivo bioluminescence imaging showed that the constitutive and induced NF-kappa B activities of transgenic mice were detected in most of the lymphoid tissues, demonstrating that NF-kappa B-driven luminescence reflected the inflammatory response in vivo. By the implantation of genipin-cross-linked gelatin conduit (GGC) and bacterial endotoxin-immersed GGC in the dorsal region, we detected a strong and specific luminescent signal from the tissue around the bacterial endotoxin-immersed GGC implant. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis also demonstrated that inflammation, characterized by the infiltration of immune cells, the accumulation of fluid, and the activation of NF-kappa B, was evoked around the same region.

Chimera of the PVA strains were utilized to map viral genomic regions important for cross-protection. The coat protein (CP) encoding region and the helper component proteinase (HCpro) affected cross-protection and virus accumulation. An amino acid substitution at the CP N-terminus reduced virus accumulation and the ability to overcome cross-protection, whereas amino acid substitutions introduced to the HCpro increased virus accumulation and the ability to overcome cross-protection. Closer sequence relatedness between the protector and challenger isolate, as determined by the CP-encoding sequence, was correlated with an increased cross-protection ability. Cross-protection was not overcome by inoculation with nonencapsidated viral RNA.

During the past decade, there have been new understandings and developments in the diagnosis, etiology, and early and late management of the disease. As the diagnosis of AP is most often established by clinical symptoms and laboratory testing, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically. Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed. Patients with organ failure and/or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) should be admitted to an intensive care unit or intermediary care setting whenever possible. Aggressive hydration should be provided to all patients, unless cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidites preclude it. Early aggressive intravenous hydration is most beneficial within the first 12-24 h, and may have little benefit beyond. Patients with AP and concurrent acute cholangitis should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 24 h of admission. Pancreatic duct stents and/or postprocedure rectal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) suppositories should be utilized to lower the risk of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe AP and/or sterile necrosis is not recommended. In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis may be useful in delaying intervention, thus decreasing morbidity and mortality. In mild AP, oral feedings can be started immediately if there is no nausea and vomiting. In severe AP, enteral nutrition is recommended to prevent infectious complications, whereas parenteral nutrition should be avoided. Asymptomatic pancreatic and/or extrapancreatic necrosis and/or pseudocysts do not warrant intervention regardless of size, location, and/or extension. In stable patients with infected necrosis, surgical, radiologic, and/or endoscopic drainage should be delayed, preferably for 4 weeks, to allow the development of a wall around the necrosis.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0002-9270,1572-0241,,NA,NA,SEP,2013,108,9,,,,NA,1400,1415,,10.1038/ajg.2013.218,NA,NA,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,NA,WOS:000324708500004,23896955,66,1,"American College of Gastroenterology Guidelines: Management of Acute Pancreatitis (Retraction of vol 108, pg 1400, 2013)",1,american college of gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis,american college of gastroenterology guideline: management of acute pancreatitis,FALSE,19-Nov-15,05-Feb-14,30-Jul-13,2015,2014,2013

Mechanisms of action are not clearly elucidated but may include their ability to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, to reduce inflammation, and to enhance tissue repair at the site of injury. This approach is controversial and evidence in large animals is missing. Side effects of MSC infusion such as the contribution to a fibrotic process have been reported in experimental settings. Nevertheless, MSCs moved quickly from bench to bedside and over 280 clinical trials are registered, of which 28 focus on the treatment of liver diseases. If no severe side-effects were observed so far, long-term benefits remain uncertain. More preclinical data regarding mechanisms of action, long term safety and efficacy are warranted before initiating large scale clinical application. The proposal of this review is to visit the current state of knowledge regarding mechanisms behind the therapeutic effects of MSCs in the treatment of experimental liver diseases, to address questions about efficacy and risk, and to discuss recent clinical advances involving MSC-based therapies.

Previous studies have demonstrated that neutrophil elastase (NE) stimulates the secretion of MUC5AC from airway epithelial cells, however, the mechanism is poorly understood. NE is a known ligand for protein active receptors (PARs), which have been confirmed to participate in releasing MUC5AC in the airways. However, the role of PARs in NE-induced MUC5AC secretion remains unclear. We demonstrated that airway goblet-like Calu-3 cells express PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3 with a predominant level of PAR2. NE can increase PAR2 expression and MUC5AC release. In our study, we showed that NE binding to PAR2 can increase the cytosolic calcium concentration and subsequently activate PKC, leading to MUC5AC secretion. In order to investigate the mechanism of increased cytosolic calcium in Calu-3 cells, thapsigargin was used to exhaust the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium pools, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate was used to inhibit the function of the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channels in the plasma membrane.

Age matched controls for rats, and calves were maintained at ambient altitude and normoxia. The effect of hypoxia on transporter expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR analysis of transporter mRNA expression in hypoxic and control rat choroid-retina. The effect of hypoxia on the activity of PEPT, OCT, ATB(0+), and MCT transporters was evaluated using in vitro transport studies of model transporter substrates across calf cornea and sclera-choroid-RPE (SCRPE). Quantitative gene expression analysis of 84 transporters in rat choroid-retina showed that 29 transporter genes were up regulated or down regulated by >= 1.5-fold in hypoxia. Nine ATP binding cassette (ABC) families of efflux transporters including MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, MRP6, MRP7, Abca17, Abc2, Abc3, and RGD1562128 were up-regulated. For solute carrier family transporters, 11 transporters including SLC10a1, SLC16a3, SLC22a7, SLC22a8, SLC29a1, SLC29a2, SLC2a1, SLC3a2, SLC5a4, SLC7a11, and SLC7a4 were up regulated, while 4 transporters including SLC22a2 SLC22a9, SLC28a1, and SLC7a9 were down-regulated in hypoxia. Of the three aquaporin (Aqp) water channels, Aqp-9 was down-regulated, and Aqp-1 was up regulated during hypoxia. Gene expression analysis showed down regulation of OCT-1, OCT-2, and ATB(0+) and up regulation of MCT-3 in hypoxic rat choroid-retina, without any effect on the expression of PEPT-1 and PEPT-2. Functional activity assays of PEPT, OCT, ATB(0+), and MCT transporters in calf ocular tissues showed that PEPT, OCT, and ATB(0+). functional activity was down-regulated, whereas MCT functional activity was up regulated in hypoxic cornea and SCRPE. Gene expression analysis of these transporters in rat tissues was consistent with the functional transport assays except for PEPT transporters. Chronic hypoxia results in significant alterations in the mRNA expression and functional activity of solute transporters in ocular tissues.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1543-8384,,,NA,NA,JUN,2013,10,6,,,,NA,2350,2361,,10.1021/mp3007133,NA,NA,"Medicine, Research & Experimental; Pharmacology & Pharmacy",Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,NA,WOS:000320015600026,23607566,934,1,"Hypoxia Alters Ocular Drug Transporter Expression and Activity in Rat and Calf Models: Implications for Drug Delivery (Retraction of vol 10, pg 2350, 2013)",1,hypoxia alters ocular drug transporter expression and activity in rat and calf models: implications for drug delivery,hypoxia alters ocular drug transporter expression and activity in rat and calf models: implications for drug delivery,TRUE,03-Feb-15,06-Jul-15,03-Jun-13,2015,2015,2013

The endogenous short interfering (si) RNA involved in this pathway are processed by Dicer-like nucleases from genomic loci re-arranged to form extended inverted repeats (IRs) that produce perfect or near-perfect dsRNA molecules. Although such IR loci are commonly detected in plant genomes, their genetics, evolution and potential contribution to plant biology through endogenous silencing have remained largely unexplored. Through an exhaustive analysis performed using Arabidopsis, we provide here evidence that at least two such endogenous IRs are genetically virtually indistinguishable from the transgene constructs commonly used for RNAi in plants. We show how these loci can be useful probes of the cellular mechanism and fluidity of RNA-silencing pathways in plants, and provide evidence that they may arise and disappear on an ecotype scale, show highly cell-specific expression patterns and respond to various stresses. IR loci thus have the potential to act as molecular sensors of the local environments found within distinct ecological plant niches. We further show that the various siRNA size classes produced by at least one of these IR loci are functionally loaded into cognate effector proteins and mediate both post-transcriptional gene silencing and RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) of endogenous as well as exogenous targets. Finally, and as previously reported during plant experimental RNAi, we provide evidence that endogenous IR-derived siRNAs of all size classes are not cell-autonomous and can be transported through graft junctions over long distances, in target tissues where they are functional, at least in mediating RdDM. Collectively, these results define the existence of a bona fide, endogenous and systemic RNAi pathway in plants that may have implications in adaptation, epiallelism and trans-generational memory.

Methods and results: CSA was diagnosed by an ischemic ST change during Hotter ECG monitoring or drug-induced test. Thirty patients were randomly allocated to either NR or BD group. The number of symptomatic attacks and the total frequency of short-acting nitrates were examined based on the data in diaries written by patients. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. The median number (25-75% quartile) of attacks per week was significantly decreased in NR group, i.e., 1.0 (0.8-2.0) at baseline, 0.0 (0.0-1.0) after 4 weeks of treatment, and 0.0 (0.0-0.0) after 8 weeks of treatment (P=0 0093, P=0.0002, Wilcoxon's rank-sum test). No significant decrease was observed in BD, i.e. 1.0 (0.5-2 0) at baseline, 1.3 (0.0-3 0) after 4 weeks, and 0.0 (0.0-1.0) after 8 weeks. The number of attacks was fewer in NR than in BD group (P=0.074.

Subjects and methods: Two hundred ninety-two patients with angina in whom coronary vasospasm was documented were followed up (mean 4.3 +/- 3.6 years) to determine the relationship between the occurrence of cardiovascular events with available clinical factors including therapeutic drugs. Cardiovascular events were defined as fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disorder events. Results: Several clinical variables including age, elevated creatinine level, tow high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, presence of severe coronary artery stenosis, low left ventricutar ejection fraction, low cardiac index (CI) large left ventricutar mass, and use of beta-blockers proved to be significant risk factors for cardiovascular events. Further analysis by a stepwise regression analysis revealed that, older age (hazard ratio (HR)=1.42), tow HDL cholesterol level. (HR = 0.877), presence of severe coronary artery stenosis (HR = 49.32), and decreased CI (HR = 14.18) proved to be independent prognostic factors. Ca antagonists were prescribed to 261 patients (89.4%). Among four Ca antagonists, there were significant differences in the frequency of cardiovascular events (2.6% with benidipine, 4.2% with nifedipine, 6.0% with diltiazem, 23.1% with amlodipine; amlodipine vs. benidipine, P<0.05) although the background characteristics of the four different patient groups were non-equivalent. Conclusion: These results indicate that the morbidity of patients with vasospastic angina increased with older age, lower CI or HDL cholesterol, and presence of severe coronary artery stenosis, and that treatment with benidipine appeared to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with vasospastic angina.

Such apparent import inefficiency is very marked in guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) hepatocytes in which the cytosolic levels of two peroxisomal proteins, catalase and alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), are much higher than those found in human (Homo sapiens) hepatocytes, for example. In an attempt to provide an explanation for this phenomenon, we have cloned the guinea pig CpPEX5 gene, which encodes the peroxisomal targeting sequence type 1 (PTS 1) import receptor Pex5p, and functionally compared it with its human homologue, HsPex5p. Our results showed the following: (1) CpPEX5, like its human homologue, encodes two splice variants differing by the presence or absence of an internal region of 37 amino acids; (2) both variants were expressed in all guinea pig tissues studied; (3) both variants were equally able to complement peroxisomal import of PTS1 proteins in microinjected Delta pex5 human fibroblasts; (4) CpPex5p was as efficient as HsPex5p in mediating the peroxisomal import of proteins possessing the consensus PTS1, Ser-Lys-Leu, but much less efficient in mediating the import of proteins possessing nonconsensus PTS is (i.e. Lys-Lys-Leu of human AGT and Ala-Asn-Leu of human catalase); (5) reporter proteins with the consensus PTS1, Ser-Lys-Leu, inhibited the peroxisomal import of endogenous catalase, whereas AGT with the non-consensus Lys-Lys-Leu did not; (6) high concentrations of HsPex5p, but not CpPex5p, markedly inhibited the import of AGT, but not catalase or proteins ending in Ser-Lys-Leu; and (7) in the yeast two-hybrid system, AGT-Ser-Lys-Leu interacted with the tetratrico-peptide repeat domain of HsPex5p, but AGT-Lys-Lys-Leu did not. In addition, AGT-Ser-Lys-Leu was targeted to peroxisomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas AGT-Lys-Lys-Leu was not. These data suggest that the inefficient peroxisomal import of AGT and catalase in guinea pig cells is due to the inefficiency with which CpPex5p mediates the peroxisomal import of proteins containing non-consensus PTS1s.

The essential oil composition of leaves and the partial non-coding internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) region of ribosomal genes from indigenous cinnamon plants (Cinnamomum osmophloeum Kanch.) were investigated. Leaf essential oils from seven geographical strains of C. osmophloeum Kaneh. were obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Six chemotypes, including cinnamaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde/cinnamyl acetate, cinnamyl acetate, linalool, camphor and mixed, were identified. Seven representative geographical strains were further used to study their genetic diversity based on the partial ITS2 region using PCR amplification and DNA sequencing to evaluate the region's use in the application of DNA barcoding C. osmophloeum Kanch. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using UPGMA clustering method.

However, the properties of this network and, in particular, its selectivity for orthographic stimuli such as words and pseudowords remain topics of significant debate. Here, we approached this issue from a novel perspective by applying pattern-based analyses to functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Specifically, we examined whether, where and how, orthographic stimuli elicit distinct patterns of activation in the human cortex. First, at the category level, multivariate mapping found extensive sensitivity throughout the ventral cortex for words relative to false-font strings. Secondly, at the identity level, the multi-voxel pattern classification provided direct evidence that different pseudowords are encoded by distinct neural patterns. Thirdly, a comparison of pseudoword and face identification revealed that both stimulus types exploit common neural resources within the ventral cortical network. These results provide novel evidence regarding the involvement of the left ventral cortex in orthographic stimulus processing and shed light on its selectivity and discriminability profile.

Our findings reveal distinct activation patterns in the VWFA associated with individual letter strings, as well as for pictures. This result demonstrates that the VWFA is organized in such a way that similar words (as well as pictures) activate neurons consistently, irrespective of their exact visual appearance or location. The activation patterns for letter strings were driven primarily by orthographic similarity, and we observed no effects of semantics or lexical status (words versus pseudowords). This effect of orthographic similarity was significant only in the VWFA and not in retinotopic areas and object-selective control regions.

Recent studies with various types of cancers revealed that the epigenetic modifications are associated with the food source corresponds to dietary phytochemicals. The dietary phytochemicals have been used in Asian countries for thousands of years to cure several diseases including cancer. They have been reported to modulate the several biological processes including histone modification, DNA methylation and non-coding microRNA expression. These events play a vital role in carcinogenesis. Various studies suggest that a number of dietary compounds present in vegetables, spices and other herbal products have epigenetic targets in cancer cells. Dietary phytochemicals have been reported to repair DNA damage by enhancing histone acetylation that helps to restrain cell death, and also alter DNA methylation. These phytochemicals are able to modulate epigenetic modifications and their targets to cure several cancers. Epigenetic aberrations dynamically contribute to cancer pathogenesis. Given the individualized traits of epigenetic biomarkers, the personalized nutrition will help us to prevent various types of cancer. In this review, we will discuss the effect of dietary phytochemicals on genetic and epigenetic modifications and how these modifications help to prevent various types of cancers and improve health outcomes.

In this study, we assessed the effects of DIM on cell cycle regulation in both estrogen-dependent MCF-7 and estrogen receptor negative p53 mutant MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells. In-vitro culture studies showed that DIM dose dependently inhibited the proliferation of both cells. In addition, in-vivo xenograft model showed that DIM strongly inhibited the development of human breast tumors. Fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis showed a DIM-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Western blot analysis showed that DIM downregulated the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4 and Cdc25A, which plays an important role in G2/M phase. Furthermore, treatment of MCF-7 cells with DIM, which increased microRNA 21 expression, caused a downregulation of Cdc25A, resulting in an inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation. Taken together, our data show that DIM is able to stop the cell cycle progression of human breast cancer cells regardless of their estrogen-dependence and p53 status, by differentially modulating cell cycle regulatory pathways.

The role of the crystal lattice, which is important in conventional superconductors, also remains unclear. Here we report an anomalous increase of the distance between copper oxide planes on cooling, which results in negative thermal volume expansion, for layered ruthenium copper oxides(4,5) that have been doped to the boundary of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity. We propose that a crossover between these states is driven by spin ordering in the ruthenium oxide layers, revealing a novel mechanism for negative lattice expansion in solids. The differences in volume and lattice strain between the distinct superconducting and antiferromagnetic states can account for the phase segregation phenomena found extensively in low-doped copper oxides, and show that Cooper pair formation is coupled to the lattice.

Methods and Objectives: We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design study in 38 patients with moderate asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroids but symptomatic during a run-in phase. Infliximab (5 mg/kg) or placebo was administered by intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. We assessed clinical response by monitoring lung function, symptoms, and inhaled beta(2)-agonist usage using hand-held electronic devices. Results: The primary endpoint, change in morning PEF at Days 50-56 compared with the last 7 d of the run-in, was not significantly different on treatment. However, infliximab was associated with a decrease in mean diurnal variation of PEF at Week 8 (p = 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], -8.1 to -0.72). Furthermore, there was a decrease in the number of patients with exacerbations of asthma (p = 0.01; 95% CI, 4.4 to 52.7) and an increased probability of freedom from exacerbation with time (p = 0.03) in patients on infliximab (n = 14) compared with placebo (n = 18). In addition, infliximab decreased levels of TNF-alpha (p = 0.01) and other cytokines in sputum supernatants. There were no serious adverse events related to the study agent.

Children underwent gastroenterological, neurological, and developmental assessment and review of developmental records. Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy sampling, magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and lumbar puncture were done under sedation. Barium follow-through radiography was done where possible. Biochemical, haematological, and immunological profiles were examined. Findings Onset of behavioural symptoms was associated, by the parents, with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination in eight of the 12 children, with measles infection in one child, and otitis media in another. All 12 children had intestinal abnormalities, ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration. Histology showed patchy chronic inflammation in the colon in 11 children and reactive ileal lymphoid hyperplasia in seven, but no granulomas. Behavioural disorders included autism (nine), disintegrative psychosis (one), and possible postviral or vaccinal encephalitis (two).

Harvesting autogenous bone grafts from the ilium may cause considerable pain and may represent a significant source of postoperative morbidity. The local application of morphine can reduce pain in a rat model of bone damage. We evaluated the analgesic efficacy of administering morphine to the donor bone graft site for spinal fusion surgery. Methods. Sixty patients undergoing cervical spinal fusion surgery using autogenous bone harvested from the ilium were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group I was given saline infiltrated into the harvest site, group 2 was given 5 mg intramuscular morphine; group 3 was given 5 mg morphine infiltrated into the harvest site. After surgery, all patients were given morphine through a patient-controlled analgesia pump. Pain scores both from the harvest and the incision sites, as well as morphine use, were recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after surgery. At I yr after surgery the presence and subjective characteristics of donor site pain were recorded. Results. Total 24-h morphine use (milligrams) was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in group 3 (33.7 +/- 8.3 mg, mean +/- SD), compared with either group 1 (64.3 +/- 6.6 mg) or group 2 (59.6 +/- 9.3 mg). Pain from the graft site was scored the same at 2 h but remained significantly lower (P < 0.0001) for group 3 at all later time intervals. Pain scores from the incision site were similar among the three study groups. One year after surgery, 25% of patients reported having chronic donor site pain. The association of chronic donor site pain was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in groups 1 (33%) and 2 (37%) compared with group 3 (50/16).

Caspase-3 is a terminal caspases which plays an important role in the execution of apoptosis in all vertebrates. It was cloned from zebra fish embryos and its properties were identified through Western blotting and biological activity. In the cells over-expressing caspase-3, Western blotting with an anti-His-tag antibody confirmed the presence of caspase-3 in the three bands that were proposed to correspond to the precursor form (33 kDa), the mature forms processed at the prodomain alone (29 kDa, large subunit) and small sub unit (13 kD). Fish kidney cells were transiently co-transfected with the P-galactosidase reporter gene and either vector alone (mock), pZCASP3His (caspase-3) or pZCASP3His mutant (caspase-3 mutant). After 72 h following transfection of fish kidney cells, 35% of cells transfected with the zebra fish caspase-3 construct, pZCASP3His, showed apoptotic morphology when compared with cells transfected with the mock vector or an expression construct (pZCASP3His mutant) encoding the caspase-3 mutant lacking Cys. The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated from cell lysates by nickel-affinity column chromatography, and cleaved with thrombin. A thrombin cleavage recognition site was positioned at the fusion junction to release the caspase-3 from the fusion protein. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the cloned zebra fish caspase was a member of the caspase-3 subfamily with approximately 60% identity with caspase-3 from Xenopus, chicken and mammals.

Our analysis shows the dominance of a technicist view of translation associated with the equivalence paradigm. In contrast, we advocate a shift to a more contextualised approach informed by theoretical developments in translation studies. More specifically, we focus on two theoretical perspectives - skopos theory and cultural politics which offer related but distinct approaches to rethinking equivalence. We conclude by advocating that the translation process be reframed as a process of intercultural interaction, rather than a lexical transfer of meaning.

The recent trend towards active licensing questions this traditional role of international licensing. To overcome the focus on market entry in prior research, we analyze the motives for technology licensing. On this basis, we use data from 152 firms to test six hypotheses relating product diversification, technological diversification, and foreign direct investment to the extent of technology out-licensing, considering technological turbulence as a moderator.

We focused our attention on events at the cellular level to show the ability of celecoxib to inhibit prostate cancer growth, by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we attempted to demonstrate the expression of genes involved in the downstream events related to cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) regulation and apoptosis. Experimental Design: To determine the level of COX-2 expression, we used paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections and cancer cells (1-26) derived from N-methyl-N-nitro-so-urea/testosterone-induced rat dorsolateral prostate, and we used immunofluorescence detection and Western blot analyses with anti-COX-2 monoclonal antibodies. We conducted clonogenic cell survival assays to demonstrate cell growth inhibition at very low doses of celecoxib. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the effects on the cell cycle. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses were performed to show the effect of celecoxib on the downstream events of COX-2 and apoptosis- related targets. Results: The summary of our findings indicates that (a) these cells from chemically induced rat prostate tumors express COX-2 at both the mRNA and the protein level; (b)celecoxib significantly reduces COX-2 expression in these cancer cells; and (c) celecoxib induces cell cycle arrest at the G(1)-S phase transition point and modifies cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin D1, retinoblastoma (Rb), and phosphorylated Rb, cyclin E, p27(KIP1), and p21 (WAF1/CIP1). Furthermore, celecoxib inhibits DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis. Most importantly, celecoxib-induced apoptosis was associated with down-regulation of COX-2, nuclear factor KBp65, and with activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, apoptosis activating factor-1, and caspase-3. Conclusion: Results from the present study clearly indicate that celecoxib exerts its anticancer effect partly through COX-2-independent mechanisms in addition to the known primary function of COX-2 inhibition.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1078-0432,1557-3265,,NA,NA,15-Aug,2003,9,9,,,,NA,3503,3513,,,NA,NA,Oncology,Oncology,NA,WOS:000185172600038,12960143,716,0,"Suppression of N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea/Testosterone-Induced Rat Prostate Cancer Growth by Celecoxib: Effects on Cyclooxygenase-2, Cell Cycle Regulation, and Apoptosis Mechanism(s) (Retraction of vol 9, pg 3503, 2003)",1,"suppression of n-methyl-n-nitrosourea/testosterone-induced rat prostate cancer growth by celecoxib: effects on cyclooxygenase-2, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis mechanism","suppression of n-methyl-n-nitrosourea/testosterone-induced rat prostate cancer growth by celecoxib: effects on cyclooxygenase-2, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis mechanism",TRUE,06-Dec-14,04-Jan-16,15-Aug-03,2014,2016,2003

Recent literature relating to pathophysiology, neuropsychological outcome, and the persistent postconcussion syndrome will be integrated into the existing literature. Recent findings The MTBI literature is enormous, complex, methodologically flawed, and controversial. There have been dozens of studies relating to pathophysiology, neuropsychological outcome, and the postconcussion syndrome during the past year. Two major reviews have been published. Some of the most interesting prospective research has been done with athletes. Summary The cognitive and neurobehavioral sequelae are self-limiting and reasonably predictable. Mild traumatic brain injuries are characterized by immediate physiological changes conceptualized as a multilayered neurometabolic cascade in which affected cells typically recover, although under certain circumstances a small number might degenerate and die. The primary pathophysiologies include ionic shifts, abnormal energy metabolism, diminished cerebral blood flow, and impaired neurotransmission. During the first week after injury the brain undergoes a dynamic restorative process. Athletes typically return to pre-injury functioning (assessed using symptom ratings or brief neuropsychological measures) within 2-14 days. Trauma patients usually take longer to return to their pre-injury functioning. In these patients recovery can be incomplete and can be complicated by preexisting psychiatric or substance abuse problems, poor general health, concurrent orthopedic injuries, or comorbid problems (e.g. chronic pain, depression, substance abuse, life stress, unemployment, and protracted litigation).",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0951-7367,,,NA,NA,MAY,2005,18,3,,,,,301,317,,10.1097/01.yco.0000165601.29047.ae,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000228760600013,16639155,3761,J,"De Monte, VE; Geffen, GM; May, CR; McFarland, K",NA,,NA,"De Monte, Veronica Eileen; Geffen, Gina Malke; May, Christopher Randall; McFarland, Ken",NA,,"Double cross validation and improved sensitivity of the rapid screen of mild Traumatic Brain Injury (Retraction of vol 26, pg 628, 2004)",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1380-3395,,,NA,NA,NOV,2007,29,8,,NA,,NA,904,904,,10.1080/13803390701745678,,NA,"Psychology, Clinical; Clinical Neurology; Psychology",Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology,NA,WOS:000251931900013,18030635,NA,2004,"De Monte, VE"," Geffen, GM"," May, CR"," McFarland, K",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"De Monte, VE; Geffen, GM; May, CR; McFarland, K",NA,,NA,"De Monte, VE; Geffen, GM; May, CR; McFarland, K",NA,,"Double cross-validation and improved sensitivity of the rapid screen of mild traumatic brain injury (Retracted Article.

Recent studies have revealed the involvement of the transactivation of proinflammatory genes by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and Ets-1 in the pathogenesis of IA formation and enlargement. OBJECTIVE: To examine the regressive effect of chimeric decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), which simultaneously inhibit NF-kappa B and Ets-1, on IA development in the rat model. METHODS: One month after IA induction, rats were treated with NF-kappa B decoy ODNs or chimeric decoy ODNs. Size, media thickness, macrophage infiltration, and collagen biosynthesis in IA walls were analyzed in both groups. RESULTS: The treatment with chimeric decoy ODNs decreased IA size and thickened IA walls of preexisting IAs induced in the rat model, although the treatment with NF-kappa B decoy ODNs failed to regress preexisting IAs. Chimeric decoy ODN-treated rats exhibited decreased expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage infiltration in IA walls. In addition, decreased collagen biosynthesis in IA walls was ameliorated in the chimeric decoy ODN-treated group.

The overexpression. of Ets-1 was sufficient to induce FasL promoter-dependent expression and protein synthesis. Ets-1 activation of the promoter was abrogated either by deletion or mutation of the Sp1 binding site. The overexpression of Ets-1 together with Sp1 produced cooperative activation of the Fas1, promoter. Sp1 induction of the FasL promoter was abrogated by an Ets-1 mutant lacking the activation domain. Conversely, Ets-1 activation of the promoter was blocked by an Sp1 mutant bearing the DNA-binding domain. The mutation of the (-365)GGAA(-362) element in the FasL promoter abolished Ets-1 activation and attenuated Sp1-inducible gene expression.

Cells were cultured on fibronectin with epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor BB and 2% or less fetal calf serum. It was found that 1/5 x 10(3) CD45(-)GlyA(-) cells, or 1/10(6) bone marrow mononuclear cells, gave rise to clusters of small adherent cells. Cell-doubling time was 48 to 72 hours, and cells have been expanded in culture for more than 60 cell doublings. MPCs are CD34(-), CD44(low), CD45(-), CD117 (cKit)(-), class I-HLA(-), and HLA-DR(-).

It has been identified as a major target for destruction during the process of apoptosis. Recent research has also highlighted a role for cytoskeletal components in the initiation and inhibition of apoptotic processes. The high degree of conservation that exists between actins from divergent eukaryotes, particularly with respect to those that contribute to the cytoskeleton, has meant that functional studies from the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have proven useful in elucidating its cellular roles. Within the context of apoptosis in yeasts, actin seems to function as part of the signalling mechanisms that link nutritional sensing to a mitochondrial-dependent commitment to cell death. Studies in yeasts have also shown that oxidative damage accrued by the actin cytoskeleton is closely monitored and is tethered to an apoptotic response. Strong, but as yet, undefined links between the actin cytoskeleton and apoptosis have also been described in studies from plant and animal systems. The widespread involvement of actin in apoptotic mechanisms from diverse eukaryotic organisms raises the possibility of conserved regulatory pathways, further strengthening the relevance of yeast research in this area.

A two-hybrid interaction between Oye2p and actin led us to investigate a possible function in the actin cytoskeleton. We found that oye deletion strains have an overly elaborate actin cytoskeleton that cannot be attributed to changes in actin concentration but likely reflect stabilization of actin filaments, resulting in excessive actin assembly. Cells expressing the actin mutant act1-123p, which has a weakened interaction with Oye2p, show comparable defects in actin organization to the oye deletion strain that can be suppressed by overexpression of Oye2p. Similarly, mutation of either conserved cysteine of the potential disulfide pair Cys285-Cys374 in actin completely suppresses the actin organization defect of the oyeDelta phenotype. Strains lacking Oye function are also sensitive to oxidative stress as induced by H(2)O(2), menadione, and diamide treatment. Mutation of either Cys285 or Cys374 of actin suppresses the sensitivity of oyeDelta strains to oxidative stress and in fact confers super-resistance to oxidative stress in otherwise wild-type strains. These results suggest that oxidative damage to actin, like that which has been observed in irreversibly sickled red blood cells, may be a general phenomenon and that OYE functions to control the redox state of actin thereby maintaining the proper plasticity of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition to uncovering a long sought biological function for Old Yellow Enzyme, these results establish that cellular sensitivity to oxidative stress can in part be directly attributed to a specific form (C285-C374 disulfide bond formation) of oxidative damage to actin.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1059-1524,,,NA,NA,OCT,2004,15,10,,,,NA,4522,4531,,10.1091/mbc.E04-06-0445,NA,NA,Cell Biology,Cell Biology,NA,WOS:000224162200016,15304519,372,1,"Old Yellow Enzyme Protects the Actin Cytoskeleton from Oxidative Stress (Retraction of vol 15, pg 4522, 2004)",1,old yellow enzyme protects the actin cytoskeleton from oxidative stress,old yellow enzyme protects the actin cytoskeleton from oxidative stress,TRUE,18-Dec-09,13-Oct-17,10-Aug-04,2009,2017,2004

However, in some developmental contexts and cell systems beta-catenin also acts as a positive modulator of apoptosis. To get additional insights into the role of beta-Catenin in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis, we have analyzed the levels and subcellular localization of endogenous beta-catenin and its relation with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) during the cell cycle in S-phase-synchronized epithelial cells. beta-Catenin levels increase in S phase, reaching maximum accumulation at late G2/M and then abruptly decreasing as the cells enter into a new G1 phase. In parallel, an increased cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of beta-catenin and APC is observed during S and G2 phases. In addition, strong colocalization of APC with centrosomes, but not beta-catenin, is detected in M phase. Interestingly, overexpression of a stable form of beta-catenin, or inhibition of endogenous beta-catenin degradation, in epidermal keratinocyte cells induces a G2 cell cycle arrest and leads to apoptosis.

In the present study, confocal microscopy and EPR spectroscopy studies showed that the addition of nitrite, a product of NR, increased the level of nitric oxide (NO). This increase was prevented by the addition of sodium azide, an inhibitor of NR. The results suggest that in wheat leaves one of the key functions of NR is the formation of the signaling NO molecule. Cultivation of green plants under conditions of prolonged (4 days) darkness, a strong stress factor for photosynthesizing cells, decreased the activity of NR. Moreover, darkness induced significant elevation of the POX activity that was prevented by the addition of nitrate to the growth medium.

Inhibitors of the P protein of GDC block its NO synthase (NOS)-like activity, and variant P produced in E. coli or insect cells displays NOS activity. The plant enzyme shares many biochemical and kinetic properties with animal NOSs. However, only a few of the critical motifs associated with NO production in animals can be recognized in the variant P sequence, suggesting that it uses very different chemistry for NO synthesis. Since nitrate reductase is likely responsible for NO production in uninfected or nonelicited plants, our results suggest that plants, like animals, use multiple enzymes for the synthesis of this critical hormone.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0092-8674,1097-4172,,NA,NA,16-May,2003,113,4,,,,NA,469,482,,10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00350-7,NA,NA,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology,NA,WOS:000182981500009,12757708,33,0,"The pathogen-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in plants is a variant of the p protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex (Retraction of vol 113, pg 469, 2003)",1,the pathogen-inducible nitric oxide synthase in plants is a variant of the p protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex,the pathogen-inducible nitric oxide synthase in plants is a variant of the p protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex,TRUE,14-Apr-12,29-Oct-04,16-May-03,2012,2004,2003

On activation of the Wg signaling pathway, Armadillo is stabilized, causing target genes to be activated by the transcription factor Pangolin (Pan). This study investigated the roles of Pan in the developing wing of Drosophila by clonal analysis. Three different aspects of wing development were examined: cell proliferation, wing margin specification, and wg self-refinement. Our results indicate that Pan function is critically required for all three of these processes. Consequently, lack of pan causes a severe reduction in the activity of the Wg target genes Distalless and vestigial within their normal domain of expression. Loss of pan function does not, however, lead to a derepression of these genes outside this domain. Thus, although Pan is positively required for the induction of Wg targets in the wing imaginal disk, it does not appear to play a default repressor function in the absence of Wg input. In contrast, lack of zygotic pan function causes a milder phenotype than that caused by the lack of wg function in the embryo. We show that this difference cannot be attributed to maternally provided pan product, indicating that a Pan repressor function usually prevents the expression of embryonic Wg targets. Together, our results suggest that for embryonic patterning the activator as well as repressor forms of Pan play important roles, while for wing development Pan operates primarily in the activator mode.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-8424,,,NA,NA,13-May,2003,100,10,,,,,5846,5851,,10.1073/pnas.1037533100,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000182939400052,12730381,3975,J,"Chan, SK; Struhl, G",NA,,NA,"Chan, SK; Struhl, G",NA,,"Evidence that Armadillo transduces wingless by mediating nuclear export or cytosolic activation of Pangolin (Retraction of vol 111, pg 265, 2002)",CELL,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0092-8674,,,NA,NA,06-Feb,2004,116,3,,NA,,NA,481,481,,,,NA,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology,NA,WOS:000188825800015,NA,NA,2002,"Chan, SK"," Struhl, G",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Chan, SK; Struhl, G",NA,,NA,"Chan, SK; Struhl, G",NA,,"Evidence that Armadillo transduces Wingless by mediating nuclear export or cytosolic activation of Pangolin (Retracted Article.

To help understand the expansion mechanism responsible for these disorders, we have crossed mice containing approximate to 147 CGG center dot CCG repeats in the endogenous murine Fmr1 gene with mice containing a null mutation in the gene encoding the mismatch repair protein MSH2. MSH2 mutations are associated with elevated levels of generalized microsatellite instability. However, we show here for the first time that in the FX mouse model, all maternally and paternally transmitted expansions require Msh2. Even the loss of one Msh2 allele reduced the intergenerational expansion frequency significantly. Msh2 is also required for all somatic expansions and loss of even one functional Msh2 allele reduced the extent of somatic expansion in some organs. Tissues with lower levels of MSH2 were more sensitive to the loss of a single Msh2 allele. This suggests that MSH2 is rate limiting for expansion in this mouse model and that MSH2 levels may be a key factor that accounts for tissue-specific differences in expansion risk.

SCF on its own cannot drive noncycling hematopoietic progenitor cells into the cell cycle but does prevent their apoptotic death. SCF when combined with other cytokines increases the cloning efficacy of hematopoietic progenitor cells from all lineages. SCF also stimulates the growth of CD34+ leukemic progenitor cells from most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mRNA expression of the SCF receptor c-kit has been shown to be significantly increased in all fresh AML blast cells compared with normal controls (healthy volunteers), in particular CD34+ cells. Two inhibitory cytokines, transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-4, decreased c-kit expression, whereas tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased c-kit expression, but chemotherapeutic drugs showed no effect on c-kit expression in AML cells. Apoptosis has been shown to be directly related to a high complete remission rate in AML patients following induction therapy. Since SCF has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of mainly CD34+ AML cells, we have investigated whether the poor response of patients with CD34+ myeloid leukemia cells to chemotherapy could be due to SCF-induced resistance to apoptosis. The effect of SCF on the apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used in the treatment of AML - cytarabine, daunorubicin and carboplatin - was examined in human CD34+ myeloid leukemia cells in serum-free cultures. SCF significantly reduced the induced apoptosis by more than 50% in all CD34+ human leukemia cells treated by any of the three chemotherapeutic drugs. Antibodies blocking c-kit reversed the significant inhibitory effect of SCF on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, confirming the role of SCF in the resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in CD34+ human leukemia. These results suggest that the poor response of patients with CD34+ leukemia cells could be at least partially due to less chemotherapy-induced apoptosis resulting from protection by SCF as an adjuvant mechanism for drug resistance in myeloid leukemia. We conclude that an antisense strategy to block c-kit expression in AML blast cells may prove valuable for decreasing the chemoresistance of AML patients.

The most efficacious approaches operate at different stages, including: 1) priming the immune response using tumor antigen-expressing dendritic cells or tumor cells transfected with genes that render them immunogenic, 2) sustaining and amplifying immunity using agonistic monoclonal antibodies against costimulatory molecules or immune-potentiating cytokines, and 3) eliminating mechanisms that self-regulate the strength of the immune response, such as inhibitory receptors or regulatory T cells.

Design: Prepubertal children with moderate OSA clinically judged to require both adenotonsillectomy and orthodontic treatment were randomized into 2 treatment groups. Group 1 underwent adenotonsillectomy followed by orthodontic expansion. Group 2 underwent therapies in the reverse sequence. Subjects: Thirty-two children (16 girls) in an academic sleep clinic. Method: Clinical evaluation and polysomnography were performed after each stage to assess efficacy of each treatment modality. Results: The 2 groups were similar in age, symptoms, apnea-hypopnea index, and lowest oxygen saturation. Two children with orthodontic treatment first did not require subsequent adenotonsillectomy. Thirty children underwent both treatments. Two of them were still symptomatic and presented with abnormal polysomogram results following both therapies.

Members of FGF (fibroblast growth factor) family play important roles in embryogenesis, e.g. in organogenesis, proliferation, differentiation, cell migration, angiogenesis, and wound healing. To dissect spatiotemporally the versatile roles of FGF during embryogenesis, we profiled gene expression in Xenopus embryo explants treated with SU5402, a chemical inhibitor specific to FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1), by microarray. We identified 38 genes that were down-regulated and 5 that were up-regulated in response to SU5402 treatment from stage 10.5-11.5 and confirmed their FGF-dependent transcription with RT-PCR analysis and whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH). Among the 43 genes, we identified 26 as encoding novel proteins and investigated their spatial expression pattern by WISH. Genes whose expression patterns were similar to FGFR1 were further analysed to test whether any of them represented functional FGF target molecules. Here, we report two interesting genes: one is a component of the canonical Ras-MAPK pathway, similar to mammalian mig6 (mitogen-inducible gene 6) acting in muscle differentiation; the other, similar to GPCR4 (G-protein coupled receptor 4), is a promising candidate for a gastrulation movement regulator.

We have recently identified ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1) as a specific and high affinity receptor for SPC, and G2A as a receptor with high affinity for LPC, but low affinity for SPC. Among G protein-coupled receptors, GPR4 shares highest sequence homology with OGR1 (51%). In this work, we have identified GPR4 as not only another high affinity receptor for SPC, but also a receptor for LPC, albeit of lower affinity. Both SPC and LPC induce increases in intracellular calcium concentration in GPR4-, but not vector-transfected MCF10A cells. These effects are insensitive to treatment with BN52021, WEB-2170, and WEB-2086 (specific platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonists), suggesting that they are not mediated through an endogenous PAF receptor. SPC and LPC bind to GPR4 in GPR4-transfected CHO cells with K(d)/SPC = 36 nM, and K(d)/LPC = 159 nM, respectively. Competitive binding is elicited only by SPC and LPC. Both SPC and LPC activate GPR4-dependent activation of serum response element reporter and receptor internalization.

SPC and LPC stimulate DNA synthesis in GPR4-expressing Swiss 3T3 cells. Both extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and DNA synthesis stimulated by SPC and LPC are pertussis toxin-sensitive, suggesting the involvement of a G(i)-heterotrimeric G protein.

Methods 12 children (mean age 6 years [range 3-10], 11 boys) were referred to a paediatric gastroenterology unit with a history of normal development followed by loss of acquired skills, including language, together with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Children underwent gastroenterological, neurological, and developmental assessment and review of developmental records. Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy sampling, magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and lumbar puncture were done under sedation. Barium follow-through radiography was done where possible. Biochemical, haematological, and immunological profiles were examined. Findings Onset of behavioural symptoms was associated, by the parents, with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination in eight of the 12 children, with measles infection in one child, and otitis media in another. All 12 children had intestinal abnormalities, ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration. Histology showed patchy chronic inflammation in the colon in 11 children and reactive ileal lymphoid hyperplasia in seven, but no granulomas. Behavioural disorders included autism (nine), disintegrative psychosis (one), and possible postviral or vaccinal encephalitis (two). There were no focal neurological abnormalities and MRI and EEG tests were normal. Abnormal laboratory results were significantly raised urinary methylmalonic acid compared with age-matched controls (p=0.003), low haemoglobin in four children, and a low serum IgA in four children.

Although hormone therapy with an antiestrogen agent is an optional therapy for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancers, both basic and clinical researches are insufficient. We here examine the efficacy of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) for peritonitis carcinomatosa, the late stage of ovarian cancer. Methods: Estrogen receptor (ER)alpha was assayed in four ovarian cancer cell lines by the RT-PCR method. Using ovariectomized nude mice, peritonitis carcinomatosa consisting of OVCAR-3 cells with the strongest ER alpha expression or DISS cells with weaker ER alpha expression was prepared. The survival period was compared between the letrozole group (5 mg/kg/day orally; n = 10) and the control group (n = 10). In addition, the degree of angiogenesis and occurrence of apoptosis were compared using tumor tissue from the abdominal cavity. The expression of aromatase and the protein involving in ER alpha signaling were examined in tumors immunohistochemically. Results: Survival period in OVCAR-3 tumors was significantly prolonged in the letrozole group, compared with the control group (P < 0.05), whereas that in DISS tumors was not different between the both groups. The microvessel density in tumors and expression of VEGF decreased significantly in the letrozole group compared to the control group. The incidence of apoptosis did not differ significantly between these groups. No adverse event was observed accompanying the administration of letrozole. The expressions of aromatase, ER alpha and FOXP1 that is associated with ER alpha signaling were reduced in tumors by letrozole administration.

Here we demonstrate, using quantitative PCR to measure ERalpha and ERbeta levels in 58 ovarian cancer patients, that ERbeta expression decreased in cysts and ovarian carcinomas as compared with normal ovaries and that this decrease is attributable only to a selective loss in ERbeta expression during cancer progression. To address the question of a possible involvement of ERbeta in ovarian cancers, we restored ERalpha and ERbeta expression in two human ovarian cancer cell lines PEO14 (ERalpha-negative) and BG1 (ERalpha-positive) using adenoviral delivery. ERalpha, but not ERbeta, could induce progesterone receptor and fibulin-IC. Moreover, ERalpha and ERbeta had opposite actions on cyclin D1 gene regulation, because ERbeta down-regulated cyclin D1 gene expression, whereas ERalpha increased cyclin D1 levels. Interestingly, ERbeta expression strongly inhibited PEO14 and BG1 cell proliferation and cell motility in a ligand-independent manner, whereas ERalpha had no marked effect. Induction of apoptosis by ERbeta also contributed to the decreased proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, as shown by Annexin V staining. This study shows that ERbeta is an important regulator of proliferation and motility of ovarian cancer and provides the first evidence for a proapoptotic role of ERbeta.

The inflammatory milieu induced in type 2 diabetes exacerbates islet dysfunction and insulin resistance, and therapies that target inflammation can improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Inflammation in type 2 diabetes may be the result of the stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), one of the many mediators of inflammation. TLRs can be activated by both exogenous and endogenous ligands, and are responsible for activating NF kappa B and interferon-inducible inflammatory gene expression. We examined the role of the TIR-domain containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF or TICAM-1), a major signaling molecule for TLR3 and TLR4, in beta-cell function and glucose homeostasis by examining mice lacking TRIF (Trif(-/-)), TLR3 (Tlr3(-/-)) or TLR4 (Tlr4(-/-)). Male, 10-week old Trif(-/-) mice exhibit a moderate but significant increase in fasting blood glucose compared to C57BL/6 controls (12.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 9.7 +/- 0.4 mM; p < 0.05) as well as impaired glucose tolerance revealed by IPGTT (AUC: 2850 +/- 236 vs. 2050 +/- 108; p < 0.005) whereas Tlr3(-/-) and Tlr4(-/-) mice have normal glucose tolerance. Interestingly, Trif(-/-) mice have normal insulin sensitivity yet have increased plasma insulin levels (180 +/- 22 vs. 89 +/- 24 pM; p < 0.05). Islets isolated from Trif(-/-) mice have impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, with a diminished first-phase insulin response to glucose. Immunohistological analysis revealed that age-matched Trif(-/-) and control mice have normal islet morphology, although Trif(-/-) mice have increased beta-cell mass (3.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg; p < 0.05). In summary, mice lacking TRIF have hyperglycemia associated with beta-cell dysfunction that may be partly compensated for by increased beta-cell mass.

In addition, these mice demonstrate decreased adiposity, increased oxygen consumption, a decreased respiratory exchange ratio, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced insulin-signaling capacity in adipose tissue, muscle, and liver compared with control mice daring high-fat feeding.

Although viral suppressors are usually thought to act at distinct steps of the silencing machinery, there had been no consensus system so far that allowed a strict side-by-side analysis of those factors. We have set up such a system in Arabidopsis thaliana and used it to compare the effects of five unrelated viral silencing suppressors on the siRNA and miRNA pathways. Although all the suppressors inhibited RNAi, only three of them induced developmental defects, indicating that the two pathways are only partially overlapping. These developmental defects were remarkably similar, and their penetrance correlated with inhibition of miRNA-guided cleavage of endogenous transcripts and not with altered miRNA accumulation per se. Among the suppressors investigated, the tombusviral P19 protein coimmunoprecipitated with siRNA duplexes and miRNA duplexes corresponding to the primary cleavage products of miRNA precursors. Thus, it is likely that P19 prevents RNA silencing by sequestering both classes of small RNAs. Moreover, the finding here that P19 binds siRNAs and suppresses RNAi in Hela cells also suggests that this factor may be useful to dissect the RNA silencing pathways in animals. Finally, the differential effects of the silencing suppressors tested here upon other types of Arabidopsis silencing-related small RNAs revealed a surprising variety of biosynthetic and, presumably, functional pathways for those molecules.

As in the case of cation-pi interactions, the role of anions also have a marked influence on the nature and magnitude of the anion-pi interaction with interactions involving halide anions being dominated by electrostatic and the induction energies. On the other hand, dispersion energies are markedly higher in interactions involving organic anions. Apart from aiding an understanding of the origin of anion-pi interaction, we believe that the present results would help understand the basis of biomolecular structures and enzyme-substrate interactions and also aid the design of new drugs and novel ionophores/receptors.",NA,NA,NA,"Tarakeshwar, P./B-6609-2008; Kim, Dongwook/C-3909-2008; Kim, Kwang/C-7538-2012","Tarakeshwar, P./0000-0002-0893-0670; Kim, Dongwook/0000-0003-2096-3720; Kim, Kwang/0000-0002-6929-5359",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1089-5639,,,NA,NA,19-Feb,2004,108,7,,,,,1250,1258,,10.1021/jp037631a,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000188957600018,NA,136,J,"Schon, JH; Meng, H; Bao, ZN",NA,,NA,"Schon, JH; Meng, H; Bao, ZN",NA,,"Self-assembled monolayer organic field-effect transistors (Retraction of vol 413, pg 713, 2001)",NATURE,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,"Dodabalapur, Ananth/H-3043-2012; Kloc, Christian/A-2255-2011",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-0836,,,NA,NA,06-Mar,2003,422,6927,,NA,,NA,92,92,,10.1038/nature01464,,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000181343100046,12621441,NA,2001,"Schon, JH"," Meng, H"," Bao, ZN",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Schon, JH; Meng, H; Bao, Z",NA,,NA,"Schon, JH; Meng, H; Bao, Z",NA,,Self-assembled monolayer organic field-effect transistors (Retracted article.

Single molecule devices are expected to have interesting electronic properties, but devices based on an array of molecules are easier to fabricate and could potentially be more reliable. However, most of the previous work on array-based devices focused on two-terminal structures: demonstrating, for example, negative differential resistance(8), rectifiers(9), and re-configurable switching(10,11). It has also been proposed that diode switches containing only a few two-terminal molecules could be used to implement simple molecular electronic computer logic circuits(12). However, three-terminal devices, that is, transistors, could offer several advantages for logic operations compared to two-terminal switches, the most important of which is 'gain'-the ability to modulate the conductance. Here, we demonstrate gain for electronic transport perpendicular to a single molecular layer (similar to 10-20 Angstrom) by using a third gate electrode. Our experiments with field-effect transistors based on self-assembled monolayers demonstrate conductance modulation of more than five orders of magnitude.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third gasotransimitter, is an endogenous neuromodulator, which facilitates the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation, involving the functions of learning and memory. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of intracerebroventricular injection of FA on the formation of learning and memory and the generation of endogenous H2S in the hippocampus of rats. We found that the intracerebroventricular injection of FA in rats impairs the function of learning and memory in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition test and increases the formation of apoptosis and lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus. We also showed that FA exposure inhibits the expression of cystathionine beta-synthase, the major enzyme responsible for endogenous H2S generation in hippocampus and decreases the production of endogenous H2S in hippocampus in rats. These results suggested that FA-disturbed generation of endogenous H2S in hippocampus leads to the oxidative stress-mediated neuron damage, ultimately impairing the function of learning and memory.

Our purpose is to provide a comprehensive examination and discussion of the potential role of COX-2 in oral cancer development and the use of COX-2 inhibitors for oral cancer chemoprevention or treatment. The data in the literature strongly indicate that COX-2 is significantly upregulated in oral cancer and premalignant lesions, and we believe that inhibition of COX-2 would suppress development of oral lesions by affecting several pathways of oral carcinogenesis.

To see if individuals at high risk of oral cancer are candidates for treatment with selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), levels of COX-2 expression in healthy, premalignant and cancerous oral mucosa were compared with the occurrence of DNA ploidy status as a genetic risk marker of oral cancer. COX-2 gene product was evaluated immunohistochemically in 30 healthy persons, in 22 patients with dysplastic lesions without previous or concomitant carcinomas, and in 29 patients with oral carcinomas. The immunohistochemical findings were verified by western blotting. COX-2 expression was correlated to DNA content as a genetic risk marker of oral cancer. COX-2 was up-regulated from healthy to premalignant to cancerous oral mucosa. Thus, COX-2 expression was found in 1 case of healthy oral mucosa (3%). All specimens from healthy mucosa had a normal DNA content. In patients with premalignancies. In 29 patients with oral carcinomas, cyclooxygenase-2 expression was observed in 26 (88%), and aneuploidy was observed in 25 cases (94%, P=0.04). Notably, of 22 patients with dysplastic lesions, COX-2 was exclusively expressed in a subgroup of nine patients (41%) identified to be at high risk of cancer by the aberrant DNA content of their lesions. Seven of these patients were followed for 5 years or more. An oral carcinoma developed in six of them (85%; P=0.02). These findings emphasize the need to determine whether coxibs can reduce the risk of oral cancer in patients with high-risk precancerous lesions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

All of the ligands and their silver complexes induced a concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, hydroxylation of C-3-COOH and its subsequent complexation with silver led to the production of a series of compounds with dramatically enhanced cytotoxicity, with 6-OH-C-3-COO-Ag having the greatest activity. Additionally, all of the metal-based complexes were selectively cytotoxic to both carcinoma-derived cell lines, relative to normal renal and hepatic cells. In comparative studies with cisplatin, and based on the IC50 values obtained with Hep-G2 cells, it appeared that the coumarin-silver complexes were between 2 and 5.5 times more cytotoxic than cisplatin. All of the coumarin-silver complexes inhibited DNA synthesis, which did not appear to be mediated through intercalation. Furthermore, results obtained from Ames tests showed that all of the test agents and their phase I metabolites were non-mutagenic. Taken together, these findings suggest that both hydroxylation particularly in the 6th position and complexation with silver, served to significantly augment the cytotoxic properties of C-3-COOH, to yield a compound which acts as a cyto-selective agent, as it is a significant killer of cancer, relative to normal cells. We suggest that this group of compounds may have a therapeutic role to play in the successful treatment and management of cancer in man. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In contrast, miR-30a overexpression reversed the mesenchymal appearance of cancer cells to result in a cobblestone-like epithelial phenotype. We identified Slug, one of the master regulators of EMT, as a target of miR-30a using in silico prediction. Reporter assays indicated that miR-30a could bind to the 3'-untranslted region of Slug mRNA. Furthermore, we linked miR-30a to increased expression of claudins, a family of tight junction transmembrane proteins. An interaction between Slug and E-box in the claudin promoter sequences was reduced upon miR-30a overexpression, further leading to reduction of filopodia formation and decreased invasiveness/metastasis capabilities of breast cancer cells. Consistently, delivery of miR-30a in xenografted mice decreased tumor invasion and migration. In patients with breast cancer, a significantly elevated risk of the miR-30a(low)/CLDN2(low)/FSCNhigh genotype was observed, linking to a phenotypic manifestation of larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor stage among patients.

MCF7 breast cancer cells conditionally expressing the EMT master regulator SNAI1 were used to identify early expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) and their targets that may contribute to the EMT process. Potential targets of miRNAs were identified by matching lists of in silico predicted targets and of inversely expressed mRNAs. MiRNAs were ranked based on the number of predicted hits, highlighting miR-661, a miRNA with so far no reported role in EMT. MiR-661 was found required for efficient invasion of breast cancer cells by destabilizing two of its predicted mRNA targets, the cell-cell adhesion protein Nectin-1 and the lipid transferase StarD10, resulting, in turn, in the downregulation of epithelial markers. Reexpression of Nectin-1 or StarD10 lacking the 3'-untranslated region counteracted SNAI1-induced invasion. Importantly, analysis of public transcriptomic data from a cohort of 295 well-characterized breast tumor specimen revealed that expression of StarD10 is highly associated with markers of luminal subtypes whereas its loss negatively correlated with the EMT-related, basal-like subtype. Collectively, our non-a priori approach revealed a nonpredicted link between SNAI1-triggered EMT and the down-regulation of Nectin-1 and StarD10 through the up-regulation of miR-661, which may contribute to the invasion of breast cancer cells and poor disease outcome.

ASD is a highly heritable disorder involving various genetic determinants(1). Shank2 (also known as ProSAP1) is a multi-domain scaffolding protein and signalling adaptor enriched at excitatory neuronal synapses(2-4), and mutations in the human SHANK2 gene have recently been associated with ASD and intellectual disability(5). Although ASD-associated genes are being increasingly identified and studied using various approaches, including mouse genetics(6-16), further efforts are required to delineate important causal mechanisms with the potential for therapeutic application. Here we show that Shank2-mutant (Shank2(-/-)) mice carrying a mutation identical to the ASD-associated microdeletion in the human SHANK2 gene exhibit ASD-like behaviours including reduced social interaction, reduced social communication by ultrasonic vocalizations, and repetitive jumping. These mice show a marked decrease in NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate receptor (NMDAR) function. Direct stimulation of NMDARs with D-cycloserine, a partial agonist of NMDARs, normalizes NMDAR function and improves social interaction in Shank2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, treatment of Shank2(-/-) mice with a positive allosteric modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), which enhances NMDAR function via mGluR5 activation(17), also normalizes NMDAR function and markedly enhances social interaction. These results suggest that reduced NMDAR function may contribute to the development of ASD-like phenotypes in Shank2(-/-) mice, and mGluR modulation of NMDARs offers a potential strategy to treat ASD.",NA,NA,NA,"Kim, Eunjoon/C-1566-2011; Lee, Min Goo/D-5635-2012; Kim, Daesoo/C-1625-2011","Kim, Daesoo/0000-0001-9915-1463",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-0836,1476-4687,,NA,NA,14-Jun,2012,486,7402,,,,,261,265,,10.1038/nature11208,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000305189000036,22699620,185,J,"Bangash, MA; Park, JM; Melnikova, T; Wang, DH; Jeon, SK; Lee, D; Syeda, S; Kim, J; Kouser, M; Schwartz, J; Cui, YY; Zhao, X; Speed, HE; Kee, SE; Tu, JC; Hu, JH; Petralia, RS; Linden, DJ; Powell, CM; Savonenko, A; Xiao, B; Worley, PF",NA,,NA,"Bangash, M.

The properties and roles of MP generated in different contexts are diverse and are determined by their parent cell and the pathway of their generation, which affects their content. MP are involved in multiple cellular functions, including immunomodulation, inflammation, coagulation, and intercellular communication. MP are able to deliver molecular signals in the form of lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, or functional transmembrane proteins from the parent cell to distantly located targets. In this review, we summarize some of the current knowledge regarding MP and their functional roles in transfer of proteins, nucleic acids, and signal transduction stimulators between cells of different origins in different settings. We will focus on the ability of MP to mediate angiogenesis-related signals and their effect on cell development. The investigation of MP could elucidate new cellular communication pathways and may lead to better understanding of pathophysiological processes. From a clinical point of view, MP may serve as biomarkers for disease status and may be found useful for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting angiogenesis-related conditions.

Results: Plasma RBP4 levels were significantly higher in women of normal weight compared to obese subjects when both were diagnosed with PCOS (14.1 +/- 4.6 vs. 10.9 +/- 4.5 ng/mL, p < 0.001): while in non-PCOS subjects the opposite was found (10.8 +/- 4.5 vs. 18.4 +/- 11.6 ng/mL, p < 0.01; respectively). Plasma visfatin levels were similar in PCOS and non-PCOS subjects. In non-PCOS subjects, positive correlations between RBP4 level and anthropometric parameters were observed. In PCOS, RBP4 levels inversely correlated with serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR values. No correlation was found between plasma visfatin levels and anthropometric parameters in all study groups. Similarly, no correlation was found in PCOS and non-PCOS subgroups. Additionally, there was an inverse correlation between RBP4 and LH concentrations and LH/FSH ratio in all study subjects. Conclusions: Plasma visfatin level is not a useful biomarker of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. RBP4 level reflects visceral body fat content in non-PCOS women. Decreasing RBP4 release along with increasing insulin resistance and hormonal disturbances may be a compensatory mechanism preventing deterioration in obese PCOS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Stressful experiences during very early life (particularly, maternal stress during fetal ontogeny) can permanently alter the responsiveness of the nervous system, an effect called programming or imprinting. Programming affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, brain neurotransmitter systems, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the cognitive abilities of the offspring, which can alter neural regulation of immune function. Prenatal or early life stress may contribute to the malaclaptive immune responses to stress that occur later in life. This review focuses on the effect of maternal and early life stress on immune function in the offspring across life span. It highlights potential mechanisms by which prenatal stress impacts immune functions over life span. The literature discussed in this review suggests that psychosocial stress during pre- and early postnatal life may increase the vulnerability of infants to the effects of immunotoxicants or immune-mediated diseases, with long-term consequences. Neural-immune interactions may provide an indirect route through which immunotoxicants affect the developing immune system. A developmental approach to understanding how immunotoxicants interact with maternal and early life stress-induced changes in immunity is needed, because as the body changes physiologically across life span so do the effects of stress and immunotoxicants. In early and late life, the immune system is more vulnerable to the effects of stress. Stress can mimic the effects of aging and exacerbate age-related changes in immune function. This is important because immune dysregulation in the elderly is more frequently and seriously associated with clinical impairment and death. Aging, exposure to teratogens, and psychological stress interact to increase vulnerability and put the elderly at the greatest risk for disease.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1547-691X,,,NA,NA,OCT-DEC,2008,5,4,,,,NA,419,444,,10.1080/15476910802483415,NA,NA,Toxicology,Toxicology,NA,WOS:000262848300009,19404876,2268,1,"Maternal and early life stress effects on immune function: relevance to Immunotoxicology (Retraction of vol 5, pg 419, 2008)",1,maternal and early life stress effects on immune function: relevance to immunotoxicology,maternal and early life stress effects on immune function: relevance to immunotoxicology,TRUE,27-Feb-13,02-Nov-11,05-Jan-09,2013,2011,2009

This study describes some of the endoscopic and pathological characteristics in a group of children with developmental disorders (affected children) that are associated with behavioral regression and bowel symptoms, and compares them with pediatric controls. METHODS: Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy were performed on 60 affected children (median age 6 yr, range 3-16; 53 male). Developmental diagnoses were autism (50 patients), Asperger's syndrome (five), disintegrative disorder (two), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (one), schizophrenia (one), and dyslexia (one). Severity of ileal LNH was graded (0-3) in both affected children and 37 developmentally normal controls (median age 11 yr, range 2-13 yr) who were investigated for possible inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Tissue sections were reviewed by three pathologists and scored on a standard proforma. Data were compared with ileocolonic biopsies from 22 histologically normal children (controls) and 20 children with ulcerative colitis (UC), scored in an identical manner. Gut pathogens were sought routinely. RESULTS: Ileal LNH was present in 54 of 58 (93%) affected children and in five of 35 (14.3%) controls (p < 0.001). Colonic LNH was present in 18 of 60 (30%) affected children and in two of 37 (5.4%) controls (p < 0.01). Histologically, reactive follicular hyperplasia was present in 46 of 52 (88.5%) ileal biopsies from affected children and in four of 14 (29%) with UC, but not in non-IBD controls (p < 0.01). Active ileitis was present in four of 51 (8%) affected children but not in controls. Chronic colitis was identified in 53 of 60 (88%) affected children compared with one of 22 (4.5%) controls and in 20 of 20 (100%) with UC. Scores of frequency and severity of inflammation were significantly greater in both affected children and those with UC, compared with controls (p < 0.001).

Adult male C57BL/6 mice underwent MCAO by intraluminal thread or sham surgery and MHP36 cells or vehicle were implanted into ipsilateral cortex and caudate 2 days later. Functional recovery was assessed for 28 days using cylinder and ladder rung tests and tissue analysed for plasticity, differentiation and infarct size. MHP36-implanted animals showed accelerated and augmented functional recovery and an increase in neurons (MAP-2), synaptic plasticity (synaptophysin) and axonal projections (GAP-43) but no difference in astrocytes (GFAP), oligodendrocytes (CNPase), microglia (IBA-1) or lesion volumes when compared to vehicle group. This is the first study showing a potential functional benefit of the ciNSCs, MHP36, after focal MCAO in mice, which is probably mediated by promoting neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity and axonal projections and opens up opportunities for future exploitation of genetically altered mice for dissection of mechanisms of stem cell based therapy.

D-elp1 is a noncanonical RdRP that can synthesize dsRNA from different ssRNA templates using either a primer-dependent or primer-independent initiation mechanism. Of the three core subunits, only D-elp1 depletion inhibits RNAi in S2 cells but does not affect micro RNA function. Furthermore, D-elp1 depletion results in increased steady state levels of representative transposon RNAs and a decrease in the corresponding transposon antisense transcripts and endo siRNAs. In contrast, although Dcr-2 depletion results in increased transposon RNA levels and a reduction in the corresponding endo siRNAs, there is no change in the transposon antisense RNA levels. In D-elp1 null third instar larvae transposon RNA levels are also increased and the corresponding transposon antisense RNAs are reduced. D-elp1 associates tightly with Dcr-2, similar to the Dicer-RdRP interaction observed in lower eukaryotes. These results identify an aspect of the RNAi pathway in Drosophila that suggest transposon derived endo siRNAs, critical for transposon suppression, are produced, in part, in a D-elp1 dependent step that converts transposon RNA into dsRNA that is subsequently processed by Dcr-2.

However, the identification of the longevity protein silent regulator 2 (Sir2), the founding member of the sirtuin protein family, as being NAD(+)-dependent reignited interest in this metabolite. The sirtuins (SIRT1-7 in mammals) utilize NAD(+) to deacetylate proteins in different subcellular compartments with a variety of functions, but with a strong convergence on optimizing mitochondrial function. Since cellular NAD(+) levels are limiting for sirtuin activity, boosting its levels is a powerful means to activate sirtuins as a potential therapy for mitochondrial, often age-related, diseases.

In particular, death ligands such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha activate necrosis by stimulating the formation of a complex containing receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3). Relatively little is known regarding how this complex formation is regulated. Here, we show that the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT2 binds constitutively to RIP3 and that deletion or knockdown of SIRT2 prevents formation of the RIP1-RIP3 complex in mice. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 blocks cellular necrosis induced by TNF-alpha. We further demonstrate that RIP1 is a critical target of SIRT2-dependent deacetylation. Using gain- and loss-of-function mutants, we demonstrate that acetylation of RIP1 lysine 530 modulates RIP1-RIP3 complex formation and TNF-alpha-stimulated necrosis. In the setting of ischaemia-reperfusion injury, RIP1 is deacetylated in a SIRT2-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the hearts of Sirt2(-/-) mice, or wild-type mice treated with a specific pharmacological inhibitor of SIRT2, show marked protection from ischaemic injury. Taken together, these results implicate SIRT2 as an important regulator of programmed necrosis and indicate that inhibitors of this deacetylase may constitute a novel approach to protect against necrotic injuries, including ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-0836,1476-4687,,NA,NA,13-Dec,2012,492,7428,,,,NA,199,+,,10.1038/nature11700,NA,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000312259300031,23201684,269,1,"The NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT2 is required for programmed necrosis (Retraction of vol 492, pg 199, 2012)",1,the nad-dependent deacetylase sirt2 is required for programmed necrosis,the nad-dependent deacetylase sirt2 is required for programmed necrosis,TRUE,06-Jun-13,27-Feb-14,13-Dec-12,2013,2014,2012

Not only does non-native speech perception decline, as often shown, but native language speech perception skills show improvement, reflecting a facilitative effect of experience with native language. The mechanism underlying change at this point in development, and the relationship between the change in native and non-native speech perception, is of theoretical interest. As shown in new data presented here, at the cusp of this developmental change, infants' native and non-native phonetic perception skills predict later language ability, but in opposite directions. Better native language skill at 7.5 months of age predicts faster language advancement, whereas better non-native language skill predicts slower advancement. We suggest that native language phonetic performance is indicative of neural commitment to the native language, while non-native phonetic performance reveals uncommitted neural circuitry.

Here we explore whether this capacity is uniquely human and evolved specifically for the computational problems associated with language, or whether this mechanism is shared with other species, and therefore evolved for problems other than language. We used the same materials and methods that were originally employed in tests of human infants to assess whether cotton-top tamarin monkeys can extract abstract algebraic rules. Specifically, we habituated subjects to sequences of consonant-vowel syllables that followed one of two patterns, AAB (e.g. wi wi di) or ABB (le we we). Following habituation, we presented subjects with two novel test items, one with the same pattern as that presented during habituation and one with a different pattern. Like human infants, tamarins were more likely to dishabituate to the test item with a different pattern. We conclude that the capacity to generalize rule-like patterns, at least at the level demonstrated, did not evolve specifically for language acquisition, though it remains possible that infants might use such rules during language acquisition.

The gene-specific microRNA mimics repressed protein levels, accompanied by depressed f-channel conductance and the associated rhythmic activity, without affecting mRNA levels of HCN2 and HCN4. Meanwhile, we also designed the microRNA-masking antisense based on the miR-1 and miR-133 target sites in the 3'UTRs of HCN2 and HCN4 and found that these antisense oligodeoxynucleotides markedly enhanced HCN2/HCN4 expression and function, as reflected by increased protein levels of HCN2/HCN4 and if conductance, by removing the repression of HCN2/HCN4 expression induced by endogenous miR-1/miR-133.

However, previous research only confirmed the osteoclastogenesis inhibitory effect under in vitro conditions. The aim of this study was to develop a therapeutic agent for osteoporosis based on the utilization of GNPs and confirm their effect both in vitro and in vivo. We prepared b-cyclodextrin (CD) conjugated GNPs (CGNPs), which can form inclusion complexes with curcumin (CUR-CGNPs), and used these to investigate their inhibitory effects on receptor activator of nuclear factor-kb ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). The CUR-CGNPs significantly inhibited the formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinuclear cells in BMMs without inducing cytotoxicity. The mRNA expressions of genetic markers of OC differentiation including c-Fos, nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1), TRAP, and osteoclast associated receptor (OSCAR) were significantly decreased in the presence of CUR-CGNPs. In addition, the CUR-CGNPs inhibited OC differentiation of BMMs through suppression of the RANKL-induced signaling pathway.

We employed a polymer-based nanoparticle approach to improve bioavailability. Curcumin was encapsulated with 97.5% efficiency in biodegradable nanoparticulate formulation based on poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and a stabilizer polyethylene glycol (PEG)-5000. Dynamic laser light scattering and transmission electron microscopy indicated a particle diameter of 80.9 nm. This curcumin, renamed from hereon ""as curcumin (NP)"", was characterized for its biological activity. In vitro curcumin (NP) exhibited very rapid and more efficient cellular uptake than curcumin. Estrase staining revealed that curcumin (NP) was at least as potent as or more potent than curcumin in inducing apoptosis of leukemic cells and in suppressing proliferation of various tumor cell lines. When examined by electrophoretic gel shift mobility assay, curcumin (NP) was more active than curcumin in inhibiting TNF-induced NF-kappa B activation and in suppression of NF-kappa B-regulated proteins involved in cell proliferation (cyclin D1), invasion (MMP-9), and angiogenesis (VEGF). In mice, curcumin (NP) was more bioavailable and had a longer half-life than curcumin.

Direct differentiation from stem cells to renal composed cells has been reported. They differentiate to renal composed cells and make functions. However, regarding renal regeneration, stem cells are discussed to secrete many kinds of growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines in paracrine or autocrine manner, which protect against renal injury, too. In addition, it is reported that stem cells have the ability to communicate with nearby cells via microvesicle-related RNA and proteins.

Recent studies have focused on the possibility of using human adult renal stem/progenitor cells (ARPCs) to improve the repair of AKI. Here we studied the influence of ARPCs on the healing of cisplatin-injured renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Tubular, but not glomerular, ARPCs provided a protective effect promoting proliferation of surviving tubular cells and inhibiting cisplatin-induced apoptosis. The recovery effect was specific to tubular ARPCs, occurred only after damage sensing, and was completely cancelled by TLR2 blockade on tubular ARPCs. Moreover, tubular, but not glomerular, ARPCs were resistant to the apoptotic effect of cisplatin. Tubular ARPCs operate mainly through the engagement of TLR2, the secretion of inhibin-A protein, and microvesicle-shuttled decorin, inhibin-A, and cyclin D1 mRNAs. These factors worked synergistically and were essential to the repair process. The involvement of tubular ARPC-secreted inhibin-A and decorin mRNA in the pathophysiology of AKI was also confirmed in transplant patients affected by delayed graft function. Hence, identification of this TLR2-driven recovery mechanism may shed light on new therapeutic strategies to promote the recovery capacity of the kidney in acute tubular damage. Use of these components, derived from ARPCs, avoids injecting stem cells.

Methods and Results: OFDI investigation was performed following stent implantation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We defined a flap-like structure (FS) as a disruption or discontinuation of the endoluminal vessel surface, and classified as actual flap or artifact. FS in the left main stem, or maximally 20mm distal to the guiding catheter in the proximal right coronary artery were assessed. A total of 8,931 frames in 97 patients were analyzed in a frame-by-frame fashion (0.125-mm interval). OFDI identified 8 FS in 7 patients, none of which was evident angiographically. All FS were left untreated because the operators per protocol were blinded to the OFDI images. A total of 5 FS in 5 patients (5.1%) appeared to be actual flaps in which only the intima was involved (mean distance from guiding catheter: 4.8 +/- 2.7 mm). The remaining 3 FS in 3 patients were artifacts; namely, residual blood and interface light reflectivity. There were no adverse cardiac events during 6-months follow-up. Conclusions: In 5.1% of STEM patients, post-procedural OFDI identified flaps with minimal involvement of the intima in the proximal coronary arteries.

For semiconductor nanocrystals, it was originally proposed(3) that these 'off' periods corresponded to a nanocrystal with an extra charge. A charged nanocrystal could have its photoluminescence temporarily quenched owing to the high efficiency of non-radiative ( for example, Auger) recombination processes between the extra charge and a subsequently excited electron-hole pair; photoluminescence would resume only after the nanocrystal becomes neutralized again. Despite over a decade of research, completely non-blinking nanocrystals(4,5) have not been synthesized and an understanding of the blinking phenomenon(6) remains elusive. Here we report ternary core/shell CdZnSe/ZnSe semiconductor nanocrystals that individually exhibit continuous, non-blinking photoluminescence. Unexpectedly, these nanocrystals strongly photoluminesce despite being charged, as indicated by a multi-peaked photoluminescence spectral shape and short lifetime. To model the unusual photoluminescence properties of the CdZnSe/ZnSe nanocrystals, we softened the abrupt confinement potential of a typical core/shell nanocrystal, suggesting that the structure is a radially graded alloy of CdZnSe into ZnSe. As photoluminescence blinking severely limits the usefulness of nanocrystals in applications requiring a continuous output of single photons, these non-blinking nanocrystals may enable substantial advances in fields ranging from single-molecule biological labelling(7) to low-threshold lasers(8).",NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Xiaoyong/D-5956-2012; Wang, Xiaoyong/F-9542-2012",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-0836,1476-4687,,NA,NA,04-Jun,2009,459,7247,,,,NA,686,689,,10.1038/nature08072,NA,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000266608600040,19430463,239,1,"Non-blinking semiconductor nanocrystals (Retraction of vol 459, pg 686, 2009)",1,non-blinking semiconductor nanocrystals,non-blinking semiconductor nanocrystals,TRUE,2010,26-Nov-15,04-Jun-09,2010,2015,2009

Based on flow cytometry, stimulation with opsonized bacteria (Bop) specifically up-regulated cell surface expression of PAR-2 in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner, independent of transcription or de novo protein synthesis. Primary granules were identified as a source of preformed PAR-2 that can readily be mobilized at the surface on fusion with the plasma membrane. Cellular response to PAR-2 activation, measured as changes in intracellular calcium concentration, was enhanced in PAR-2 up-regulated cells. Increase of cell-surface PAR-2 and of cell responsiveness were dependent specifically on the engagement of immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding receptors. Together, our results reveal that mobilization of intracellular granules, in response to Ig-receptor activation, up-regulates PAR-2 surface expression and makes neutrophils more responsive to proteinase activity.

GMD was induced by appropriate surgery or by the administration of acetic acid, atropine, L-DOPA, or morphine to the animals. The ITR in these GMD animals was significantly retarded compared to normal animals. The retardation, however, was significantly inhibited by the intragastric administration of PF-W (0.1-1 g/kg) in a dose dependent manner for all GMD models except for L-DOPA-induced GMD.

This prolonged inhibition can take days or weeks to resolve and often is referred to as postoperative paralytic ileus lasting more than three days after surgery. This article reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment options of postoperative ileus. METHODS: The relevant literature from 1965 to 2003 was identified and reviewed using MEDLINE database of the U.S. Medical Library of Medicine. Both retrospective and prospective studies were included in this review. RESULTS: The pathophysiology of postoperative ileus is multifactorial. The duration of postoperative ileus correlates with the degree of surgical trauma and is most extensive after colonic surgery. However, postoperative ileus can develop after all types of surgery including extraperitoneal surgery. A variety of treatment options have been used to decrease the duration of postoperative ileus. However, it is difficult to compare these studies because of small sample sizes and differences in operations performed, anesthesia protocols provided both intraoperatively and postoperatively, patient comorbidities, and in the measured end points, such as the time to the presence of bowel sounds, flatus, or bowel movements, tolerance of solid food, or discharge from the hospital. However, despite these drawbacks, some conclusions can be made. CONCLUSIONS: Paralytic postoperative Hens continues to be a significant problem after abdominal and other types of surgery. The etiology is multifactorial and is best treated with a combination of different approaches. Currently, the important factors that could effect the duration and recovery from postoperative ileus include limitation of narcotic use by substituting alternative medications such as nonsteroidals and placing a thoracic epidural with local anesthetic when possible. The selective use of nasogastric decompression and. correction of electrolyte imbalances also are important factors to consider.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0012-3706,,,NA,NA,APR,2004,47,4,,,,NA,516,526,,10.1007/s10350-003-0067-9,NA,NA,Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery,Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery,NA,WOS:000220574500019,14978625,464,1,"Postoperative ileus: a review (Retraction of vol 47, pg 516, 2004)",1,postoperative ileus: a review,postoperative ileus: a review,TRUE,14-Nov-05,23-Aug-05,Apr-04,2005,2005,2004

To address the underlying mechanism, a cloned Env from the IIIBx swarm (8x) was used to produce soluble gp120, 8x gp120 bound directly to cells expressing only CXCR4, whereas binding of IIIB gp120 required soluble CD4, Using an optical biosensor, we found that CD4-induced (CD4i) epitopes recognized by mAbs 17b and 48d were more exposed on 8x than on IIIB gp120, The ability of 8x gp120 to bind directly to CXCR4 and to react with mAbs 17b and 48d in the absence of CD4 indicated that this gp120 exists in a partially triggered but stable state in which the conserved coreceptor-binding site in gp120, which overlaps with the 17b epitope, is exposed. Substitution of the 8x V3 loop with that from the R5 virus strain Bat resulted in an Env (8x-V3BaL) that mediated CD4-independent CCR5-dependent virus infection and a gp120 that bound to CCRS in the absence of CD4. Thus, in a partially triggered Env protein, the V3 loop can change the specificity of coreceptor use but does not alter CD4 independence, indicating that these properties are dissociable, Finally, IIIBx was more sensitive to neutralization by HIV-positive human sera, a variety of anti-IIIB gp120 rabbit sera, and CD4i mAbs than was IIIB, The sensitivity of this virus to neutralization and the stable exposure of a highly conserved region of gp120 suggest new strategies for the development of antibodies and small molecule inhibitors to this functionally important domain.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-8424,,,NA,NA,25-May,1999,96,11,,,,,6359,6364,,10.1073/pnas.96.11.6359,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000080527100081,10339592,561,J,"LaCasse, RA; Follis, KE; Trahey, M; Scarborough, JD; Littman, DR; Nunberg, JH",NA,,NA,"LaCasse, RA; Follis, KE; Trahey, M; Scarborough, JD; Littman, DR; Nunberg, JH",NA,,"Fusion-competent vaccines: Broad neutralization of primary isolates of HIV (Retraction of vol 283, pg 357, 1999)",SCIENCE,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0036-8075,,,NA,NA,10-May,2002,296,5570,,NA,,NA,1025,1025,,,,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000175565000019,NA,NA,1999,"LaCasse, RA"," Follis, KE"," Trahey, M"," Scarborough, JD"," Littman, DR"," Nunberg, JH",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"LaCasse, RA; Follis, KE; Trahey, M; Scarborough, JD; Littman, DR; Nunberg, JH",NA,,NA,"LaCasse, RA; Follis, KE; Trahey, M; Scarborough, JD; Littman, DR; Nunberg, JH",NA,,"Fusion-competent vaccines broad neutralization of primary isolates of HIV (Retracted article.

The B. subtilis ZJB-063 culture conditions for the production of nitrilase and the reaction conditions for this nitrilase-mediated conversion were optimized. The maximum production of nitrilase was achieved when glucose and a combination of ammonium sulfate and yeast powder were added as carbon and nitrogen sources respectively. Previously reported inducers were found to be unnecessary for the production of nitrilase from B. subtilis ZJB-063, which indicated that this nitrilase appeared to be constitutive. However, when E-caprolactam (6-hexanolactam) was added as the inducer, B. subtilis ZJB-063 exhibited nitrile hydratase and amidase activity.

MiRNAs can specifically silence their mRNA targets regulating mRNA translation. Platelet miRNAs are reported to bind to important platelet target mRNAs involved in platelet reactivity including P2Y(12) ADP receptor, GPIIb receptor, and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A. They also regulate important functions such as platelet shape change, granules secretion, and platelet activation.

Here we developed two new approaches, the gene-specific microRNA mimic and microRNA-masking antisense approaches, to explore the possibility of using microRNA's principle of actions in a gene-specific manner. We examined the value of these strategies as rational approaches to develop heart rate-reducing agents and ""biological pacemakers"" by manipulating the expression of the cardiac pacemaker channel genes HCN2 and HCN4. We showed that the gene-specific microRNA mimics, 22-nt RNAs designed to target the 3'untranslated regions (3UTRs) of HCN2 and HCN4, respectively, were efficient in abrogating expression and function of HCN2 and HCN4. The gene-specific microRNA mimics repressed protein levels, accompanied by depressed f-channel conductance and the associated rhythmic activity, without affecting mRNA levels of HCN2 and HCN4. Meanwhile, we also designed the microRNA-masking antisense based on the miR-1 and miR-133 target sites in the 3'UTRs of HCN2 and HCN4 and found that these antisense oligodeoxynucleotides markedly enhanced HCN2/HCN4 expression and function, as reflected by increased protein levels of HCN2/HCN4 and if conductance, by removing the repression of HCN2/HCN4 expression induced by endogenous miR-1/miR-133. The experimental examination of these techniques and the resultant findings not only indicate feasibility of interfering miRNA action in a gene-specific fashion but also may provide a new research tool for studying function of miRNAs.

While primarily aimed at cancer, gene engineering and cell therapy strategies have additionally been used for Mendelian, neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. The main focus of gene and cell therapy strategies in metabolism has been diabetes mellitus, This disease is a disorder of glucose homeostasis, either due to the immune-mediated eradication of pancreatic P cells in the islets of Langerhans (type I diabetes) or resulting from insulin resistance and obesity syndromes where the insulin-producing capability of the P cell is ultimately exhausted in the face of insensitivity to the effects of insulin in the peripheral glucose-utilising tissues (type 2 diabetes). A significant number of animal studies have demonstrated the potential in restoring normoglycaemia by islet transplantation in the context of immunoregulation achieved by gene transfer of immunoregulatory genes to allo- and xenogeneic islets ex vivo. Additionally, gene and cell therapy has also been used to induce tolerance to auto- and alloantigens and to generate the tolerant state in autoimmune rodent animal models of type I diabetes or rodent recipients of allogeneic/xenogeneic islet transplants. The achievements of gene and cell therapy in type 2 diabetes are less evident, but seminal studies promise that this modality can be relevant to treat and perhaps prevent the underlying causes of the disease. Here we present an overview of the current status of gene and cell therapy for type I and 2 diabetes and we propose potential therapeutic options that could be clinically useful. For type I diabetes, transplantation of islets engineered to evade or suppress the recipient immune response is the most readily-available technology today. A number of gene delivery vectors encoding proteins that impair a variety of immune cells have already been examined and proven versatile. More challenging but, nonetheless, just over the horizon are attempts to promote tolerance to islet allografts. Type 2 diabetes will likely require a better understanding of the processes that determine insulin sensitivity in the periphery. Targeting tissues such as muscle and fat with vectors encoding genes whose products promote insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake C, C is an approach that does not carry with it the side-effects often associated with pharmacologic agents currently in use. In the end, progress in vector design, elucidation of antigen-specific immunity and insulin sensitivity C will provide the framework for gene drug use in the treatment of type I and type 2 diabetes.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1173-8804,,,NA,NA,,2002,16,3,,,,,149,173,,10.2165/00063030-200216030-00001,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000177285500001,12102644,3522,J,"Lee, HC; Kim, SJ; Kim, KS; Shin, HC; Yoon, JW",NA,,NA,"Lee, Hyun Chul; Kim, Su-Jin; Kim, Kyung-Sup; Shin, Hang-Cheol; Yoon, Ji-Won",NA,,"Remission in models of type 1 diabetes by gene therapy using a single-chain insulin analogue (Retraction of vol 408, pg 483, 2000)",NATURE,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-0836,,,NA,NA,02-Apr,2009,458,7238,,NA,,NA,660,660,,10.1038/nature07964,,NA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA,WOS:000264796200047,19340080,NA,2000,"Lee, HC"," Kim, SJ"," Kim, KS"," Shin, HC"," Yoon, JW",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Lee, HC; Kim, SJ; Kim, KS; Shin, HC; Yoon, JW",NA,,NA,"Lee, HC; Kim, SJ; Kim, KS; Shin, HC; Yoon, JW",NA,,"Remission in models of type 1 diabetes by gene therapy using a single-chain insulin analogue (Retracted Article.

Microparticle proteins were extracted and analyzed using label-free liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Peptide features were analyzed to assess the association of specific protein patterns with subjects delivering at term (>= 37 weeks gestation; n = 24) and those experiencing SPTB (<= 34 weeks gestation; n = 24). Results We found 99 proteins that had statistically significant differences in signal intensity between term and SPTB women in both first (n = 26) and second (n = 22) singleton gestation pregnancy cohorts. Additional evaluation identified 18 biomarkers that met criteria for further priority evaluation (12 preterm, 6 term). Pathway analysis showed that differentiating SPTB biomarker proteins were predominantly associated with inflammation and cell injury, while differentiating term biomarkers were associated with cell growth and hematological parameters.

The modes of transmission include intravenous drug use (IDU), blood products, tattooing and, to a lesser extent, sexual intercourse. Homelessness is a risk factor of VHB and VHC because of the environments and behaviours associated with homeless communities such as poor hygiene, nutrition and high levels of IDU.

Controversies can also be initiated by scientific publications, even though these are often biased, by a misinterpretation or the absence of official positions from the health care authorities, or by justice decisions, whose criteria differ from the scientists' ones and are therefore difficult to understand for the lay public. Furthermore, the scientific demonstration of the exclusion of a risk is difficult to obtain. In the past, it appeared to be very difficult to stop controversies.

Of the 21 078 volunteers 1618 (8%) had elevated PSA levels. Of these men 778 (48%) underwent biopsies: 197 (25%) biopsies were positive for prostate carcinoma and 135 (17%) underwent radical prostatectomy. 95 were found to be organ-confined. A PSA cut-off of 2.5 ng/ml in men aged 45-49 years and of 3.5 ng/ml in men aged 50-59 years resulted in an 8% increase in the detection rate of organ-confined disease. 284/2272 men (13 %) had elevated PSA levels and prostate carcinoma was detected in 62 men (3 %). All patients underwent radical prostatectomy and histological examination revealed organ-confined tumour in all but 8 men. 98/340 men (29 %) had biopsies positive for carcinoma: 28 of these patients (29%) had carcinoma that originated in the transition zone only. In the retrospective study, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that by using a per cent free PSA of less than 18% as a biopsy criterion, 37% of the negative biopsies could be eliminated although 94% of all carcinomas would still be detected. In the first prospective study, 106/158 men (67%) with elevated PSA levels below 10.0 ng/ml were further evaluated and 37 (35%) prostate carcinomas were detected. By using 3 per cent free PSA of <22% as a biopsy criterion. 30% of the negative biopsies could be eliminated although 98% of the carcinomas would still be detected. in the second prospective study, 120/465 men (26%) with total PSA levels between 1.25 and 6.49 ng/ml and a per cent free PSA < 18% were further evaluated and 27 (23%) were found to have prostate carcinomas. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for PSA transition zone (TZ) density showed that by using a PSA transition zone density of > 22 nd/ml/cc as a biopsy criterion, 24.4% of negative biopsies could be avoided without missing a single carcinoma. In the prescreening era the incidence of Tla Grade 1 and 3 carcinomas was 3.1% and the incidence of Tla and Tlb Grade 3 carcinoma was 2.3% whereas in the years after the establishment of PSA-based screening the incidence was 4.6 and 1.03% respectively. The rate of organ-confined tumours increased from 28.7% in 1993 to 65.7% in 1997. In this evaluation a new approach, to proceed with a prostate biopsy bused upon the: individual risk of having prostate cancer rather than a single PSA cut-off point was developed. High total PSA levels, PSA density and PSA transition zone density correlated significantly with high Gleason scores, capsular penetration, a high percentage of cancer in the prostatectomy specimen and a high cancer volume. In this evaluation all of the 95 patients with PSA levels below 3.99 ng/ml who underwent radical prostatectomy showed clinically significant, organ-confined prostate cancer with negative surgical margins. The results of this evaluation suggest that older men have larger tumour volumes compared with younger men with the same PSA levels. These data suggest that PSA-based screening with low PSA cut-off values increase the detection rate of clinically significant, organ confined and potentially curable prostate cancer. Per cent free PSA and PSA transition zone density provide an additional diagnostic benefit over total PSA. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combined treatment of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin-II receptor blocker, and monotherapy of each drug at its maximum dose, in patients with non-diabetic renal disease. Methods 336 patients with non-diabetic renal disease were enrolled from one renal outpatient department in Japan. After screening and an 18-week run-in period, 263 patients were randomly assigned angiotensin-II receptor blocker (losartan, 100 mg daily), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril, 3 mg daily), or a combination of both drugs at equivalent doses. Survival analysis was done to compare the effects of each regimen on the combined primary endpoint of time to doubling of serum creatinine concentration or endstage renal disease. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings Seven patients discontinued or were otherwise lost to follow-up. Ten (11%) of 85 patients on combination treatment reached the combined primary endpoint compared with 20 (23%) of 85 on trandolapril alone (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% Cl 0.18-0.63, p=0.018) and 20 (23%) of 86 on losartan alone (0.40, 0.17-0.69, p=0.016).

Transient transfection assays indicate that the segment from - 199 to + 1 is necessary for the activation of basal transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that the ATTGG sequence, within the - 147 to - 121 fragment, is critical to bind nuclear proteins in the proximal COL11A1 promoter. We demonstrated that the CCAAT binding factor (CBF/NF-Y) bound to this region using an interference assay with consensus oligonucleotides and a supershift assay with specific antibodies in an EMSA. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and EMSA using DNA-affinity-purified proteins, CBF/NF-Y proteins directly bound this region in vitro and in vivo.

It was previously reported that the -530-bp promoter segment of the alpha2(XI) collagen gene (Col11a2) was sufficient for cartilage-specific expression and that a 24-bp sequence from this segment was able to switch promoter activity from neural tissues to cartilage in transgenic mice when this sequence was placed in the heterologous neurofilament light gene (NFL) promoter. To identify a protein factor that bound to the 24-bp sequence of the Col11a2 promoter, we screened a mouse limb bud cDNA expression library in the yeast one-hybrid screening system and obtained the cDNA clone NT2. Sequence analysis revealed that NT2 is a zinc finger protein consisting of a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) and is a homologue of human FPM315, which was previously isolated by random cloning and sequencing. The KRAB domain has been found in a number of zinc finger proteins and implicated as a transcriptional repression domain, although few target genes for KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins has been identified. Here, we demonstrate that NT2 functions as a negative regulator of Col11a2. In situ hybridization analysis of developing mouse cartilage showed that NT2 mRNA is highly expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes but is minimally expressed by resting and proliferating chondrocytes, in an inverse correlation with the expression patterns of Col11a2. Gel shift assays showed that NT2 bound a specific sequence within the 24-bp site of the Col11a2 promoter. We found that Col11a2 promoter activity was inhibited by transfection of the NT2 expression vector in RSC cells, a chondrosarcoma cell line. The expression vector for mutant NT2 lacking the KRAB domain failed to inhibit Col11a2 promoter activity. These results demonstrate that KRAB-zinc finger protein NT2 inhibits transcription of its physiological target gene, suggesting a novel regulatory mechanism of cartilage-specific expression of Col11a2.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0270-7306,1098-5549,,NA,NA,JUN,2002,22,12,,,,NA,4256,4267,,10.1128/MCB.22.12.4256-4267.2002,NA,NA,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology,NA,WOS:000175866400028,12024037,2824,1,"A Kruppel-Associated Box-Zinc Finger Protein, NT2, Represses Cell-Type-Specific Promoter Activity of the alpha 2(XI) Collagen Gene (Retraction of vol 22, pg 4256, 2002)",1,"a kruppel-associated box-zinc finger protein, nt2, represses cell-type-specific promoter activity of the alpha 2 collagen gene","a kruppel-associated box-zinc finger protein, nt2, represses cell-type-specific promoter activity of the alpha 2 collagen gene",TRUE,11-Jun-03,15-Jun-09,Jun-02,2003,2009,2002

S.",,,DREF is required for cell and organismal growth in Drosophila and functions downstream of the nutrition/TOR pathway,DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY,,,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,"Nutrient availability is a key determinant of animal growth. The conserved insulin/PI3 kinase and TOR kinase signaling pathways are two of the best characterized regulators of cell and tissue growth in response to nutritional conditions. Studies in Drosophila larvae show that one mechanism by which these pathways drive growth is by regulating the expression of metabolic gene:, especially those genes required for protein synthesis. Here we examine a role for the transcription factor DREF in mediating some of these transcriptional and growth responses. We find that loss of DREF leads to a decrease in organismal growth. These effects are in part due to a requirement for DREF function in cell-autonomous growth. We also uncover a non-autonomous role for DREF activity in the larval fat body. Previous studies show that activation of TOR in the fat body couples nutrition to insulin release from the brain; we find that inhibition of DREF in the fat body can phenocopy effects of nutrient deprivation and fat-specific TOR inhibition, leading to a reduction in systemic insulin signaling, delayed larval growth and smaller final size. Using genetic epistasis, we find that DREF is required for growth downstream of TOR, but not insulin/PI3K signaling. Moreover, we show that TOR can control DREF inRNA levels, in part via the transcription factor dMyc. Finally we show that DREF is required for normal expression of many ribosome biogenesis genes, suggesting that one mechanism by which DREF is required for growth is through the control of protein synthetic capacity. Together these findings suggest DREF is an essential transcription factor in the nutritional control of cell and tissue growth during Drosophila development. Given that DREF is conserved, this role may also be important in the control of growth in other animals. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Twitch and fatigue were analyzed in single skeletal muscle fibers isolated from either the semitendinous or the tibialis anterior muscles dissected from the frog Rana pipiens. LASSBio-294 (12.5-100 muM) increased twitch tension, accelerated the maximal rate of tension decay during relaxation, and had very little effect in the maximal rate of tension development of muscle fibers directly stimulated at less than or equal to 30 Hz. The positive inotropic effect of LASSBio-294 developed slowly, reaching its maximum at 40 min and was inversely proportional to the frequency of stimulation, becoming negligible at 60 and 90 Hz. The concentration-response relationship for LASSBio-294-induced potentiation of twitch tension was bell-shaped, with maximal effect occurring at 25 muM. In addition, LASSBio-294 reduced development of fatigue induced by tetanic stimulation of the muscle fibers and reduced the time needed for 80% prefatigue tension recovery after fatigue had developed to 50% of the maximal pretetanic force. These effects of LASSBio-294 can be fully explained by stimulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump and could be ascribed to an increase in cellular levels of cyclic AMP due to PDE inhibition. The novel thienylhydrazone LASSBio-294 may be useful for treatment of patients suffering from conditions in which muscle fatigue is a debilitating symptom (e.g., chronic heart failure).",NA,NA,NA,"Castro, Newton/C-3263-2009; Fraga, Carlos/G-3495-2012; Barreiro, Eliezer/B-1131-2011","Castro, Newton/0000-0001-9570-7428; Fraga, Carlos/0000-0001-6733-7079; ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0022-3565,,,NA,NA,NOV,2001,299,2,,,,,558,566,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000171764100020,11602667,2244,J,"Fujii, Y; Takahashi, S; Toyooka, H",NA,,NA,"Fujii, Y.; Takahashi, S.; Toyooka, H.",NA,,"The Effects of Milrinone and Its Mechanism in the Fatigued Diaphragm in Dogs (Retraction of vol 87, pg 1077, 1998)",ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0003-2999,,,NA,NA,MAR,2013,116,3,,NA,,NA,743,743,,10.1213/ANE.0b013e31828ac1c0,,NA,Anesthesiology,Anesthesiology,NA,WOS:000315540400042,NA,NA,1998,"Fujii, Y"," Takahashi, S"," Toyooka, H",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,"Fujii, Y; Takahashi, S; Toyooka, H",NA,,NA,"Fujii, Y; Takahashi, S; Toyooka, H",NA,,"The effects of milrinone and its mechanism in the fatigued diaphragm in dogs (Retracted article.

In Groups IIa, IIb, and IIc (n = 8 in each), diaphragmatic fatigue was induced by intermittent supramaximal bilateral electrophrenic stimulation at a frequency of 20 Hz applied for 30 min.

Diaphragmatic contractility was assessed with transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi). No differences in Pdi were observed in Groups Ia and Ib. After the fatigue-producing period, Pdi at low-frequency (20-Hz) stimulation decreased from the prefatigued values in Groups IIa, Ire, and IIc (P < 0.05), whereas the decrease was minimal at high-frequency (100-Hz) stimulation. Compared with Group IIa, Pdi to each stimulus increased during milrinone infusion in Group IIb, (P < 0.05). In Group IIc, the augmentation of Pdi in the fatigued diaphragm by milrinone was not abolished with an administration of nicardipine. In conclusion, milrinone improves contractility in the fatigued canine diaphragm but not via its effect on transmembrane calcium movement.

We reasoned that resveratrol might possess the ability to protect the cells at lower doses as observed during pharmacological preconditioning of the heart, while at higher doses cause cell death as found for cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, rats were randomly fed for 14 days by gavaging any of the four doses of resveratrol - 2.5, 5.0, 25 or 50 mg/kg - while vehicle-fed animals served as placebo control. After 14 days, isolated working hearts were prepared from both experimental and control animals, and the hearts were subjected to 30-min global ischemia followed by 2 It of reperfusion. The rats fed either 2.5 or 5 mg/kg dose of resveratrol for 14 days provided cardioprotection as evidenced by improved post-ischemic ventricular recovery and reduction of myocardial infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis compared to control. In contrast, the hearts fed either 25 or 50 mg/kg dose of resveratrol depressed cardiac function and increased myocardial infarct size and number of apoptotic cells.

The results thus indicate that at lower doses (2.5 or 5 mg/kg), resveratrol exerts survival signal by up-regulating anti-apoptotic and redox proteins Akt and Bcl-2, while at higher doses (>25 mg/kg), it potentiates a death signal by down-regulating redox proteins and upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins.

Moreover, treatment with a demethylating agent increased Runx3 gene transcription, further supporting our claim that a methyl-rich diet can affect methylation status and consequent transcriptional regulation.

Recent studies have provided increasing evidence that EPCs (endothelial progenitor cells) participate in ongoing endothelial repair and postnatal neovascularization. However, the changes in EPCs in patients with hypercholesterolaemia have not been elucidated to date. Therefore we investigated the number and functional activity of EPCs in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Total MNCs (mononuclear cells) were isolated from 20 patients with hype rcholesterolaemia and 20 matched control subjects. EPCs were characterized as adherent cells double-positive for Dil-LDL (1,1'-dioctaclecyl-3,3,3,3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanide percholate-labelled low-density lipoprotein) uptake and lectin binding by direct fluorescent staining under a laser scanning confocal microscope, and were characterized further by demonstrating the expression of KDR (kinase insert domain-containing receptor), CD34 and AC133 by flow cytometry. Proliferation, migration and in vitro vasculogenesis activity of EPCs were assayed using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay, modified Boyden chamber assay and an in vitro vasculogenesis kit respectively. EPC adhesion assay was performed by replating cells on fibronectin-coated dishes and then counting the adherent cells. As a result, the number of EPCs was significantly reduced in patients with hypercholesterolaemia compared with that in control subjects (41.8 +/- 8.7 compared with 64.5 +/- 16.6 EPCs/ x 200 field respectively; P < 0.05). The number of EPCs was inversely correlated with total cholesterol (r = -0.659, P < 0.001) and LDL-cholesterol (r = -0.611, P < 0.001) levels. In addition, the functional activities of isolated EPCs, such as proliferative, migratory, adhesive and in vitro vasculogenesis capacity, were also impaired.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the association between plasma NT levels and glucose tolerance status, according to antioxidant vitamin intakes. Methods In three hundred men randomly selected from a population-based cohort, NT levels were measured and dietary intake assessed by a food-frequency questionnaire. Results NT values were similar in patients with diabetes (n = 34), impaired fasting glucose (n = 77) and normoglycaemic subjects (n = 189). However, in subjects with lower than recommended daily intakes of antioxidant vitamins C and A, NT levels were significantly higher in the diabetic patients. In a multiple regression model, after adjustments for age, body mass index (BMI) and smoking habits, NT levels were significantly associated with fasting glucose in patients with lower intakes of vitamin C (beta = 11.4; 95% CI 1.3 21.5) and vitamin A (beta = 14.9; 95% CI 3.9 25.9), but not in subjects with lower intake of vitamin E. Conclusion A significant positive correlation between NT levels and fasting glucose is evident only in the presence of a reduced intake of some antioxidant vitamins.

Like other L domains, YRKL can be inserted at different locations on the mutant M1 protein and can restore virus budding in a position-independent manner. Although YRKL is a part of the nuclear localization signal (NLS), the function of YRKL was independent of the NLS activity and the NLS function of M1 was not required for influenza virus replication. Some mutations in YRKL and the adjacent region caused a reduction in the virus titer by blocking virus release, and some affected virus morphology, producing elongated particles. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses showed that VPS28, a component of the ESCRT-I complex, and Cdc42, a member of the Rho family GTP-binding proteins, interacted with the M1 protein via the YRKL motif. In addition, depletion of VPS28 and Cdc42 by small interfering RNA resulted in reduction of influenza virus production. Moreover, overexpression of dominant-negative Cdc42 inhibited influenza virus replication, whereas a constitutively active Cdc42 mutant enhanced virus production in infected cells. These results indicated that VPS28, a component of ESCRT-I, and Cdc42, a small G protein, are associated with the M1 protein and involved in the influenza virus life cycle.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0022-538X,,,NA,NA,MAR,2006,80,5,,,,NA,2291,2308,,10.1128/JVI.80.5.2291-2308.2006,NA,NA,Virology,Virology,NA,WOS:000235388400022,16474136,3162,1,"YRKL sequence of influenza virus M1 functions as the L domain motif and interacts with VPS28 and Cdc42 (Retraction of vol 80, pg 2291, 2006)",1,yrkl sequence of influenza virus m1 functions as the l domain motif and interacts with vps28 and cdc42,yrkl sequence of influenza virus m1 functions as the l domain motif and interacts with vps28 and cdc42,TRUE,15-Oct-06,Oct-06,Mar-06,2006,2006,2006

Although these groups share many common properties, some amyloid sequences have been reported to form polymorphic structural variants or strains. We investigated the humoral immune response to A42 fibrils and produced 23 OC-type monoclonal antibodies recognizing distinct epitopes differentially associated with polymorphic structural variants. These mOC antibodies define at least 18 different immunological profiles represented in aggregates of amyloid- (A). All of the antibodies strongly prefer amyloid aggregates over monomer, indicating that they recognize conformational epitopes. Most of the antibodies react with N-terminal linear segments of A, although many recognize a discontinuous epitope consisting of an N-terminal domain and a central domain. Several of the antibodies that recognize linear A segments also react with fibrils formed from unrelated amyloid sequences, indicating that reactivity with linear segments of A does not mean the antibody is sequence-specific. The antibodies display strikingly different patterns of immunoreactivity in Alzheimer disease and transgenic mouse brain and identify spatially and temporally unique amyloid deposits. Our results indicate that the immune response to A42 fibrils is diverse and reflects the structural polymorphisms in fibrillar amyloid structures.

However, it was unclear whether the anti-A beta antibodies were able to distinguish A beta peptide from the same A beta epitopes within the amyloid precursor protein (APP). To further elucidate the identity of the immunoreactive intraneuronal material in 3xTg-AD mice, we conducted immunohistochemical, biochemical, and ultrastructural studies using a well characterized panel of antibodies that distinguish A beta within APP from cleaved A beta peptides. We found that the intraneuronal material shared epitopes with full-length APP but not free A beta. To demonstrate unequivocally that this intraneuronal material was not free A beta peptide, we generated 3xTg-AD mice deficient for beta-secretase (BACE), the protease required for A beta generation from APP. In the absence of A beta production, robust intraneuronal APP immunostaining was detected in the 3xTg-AD/BACE(-/-) mice.

Methods: Consecutive CKD patients (n = 123) were studied. They were clinically stable and receiving either ACEI ( n = 77) or ARB ( n = 46) ( physician's choice) for 6 3 months. Results: Mean pALDO in the ACEI cohort was 7.8 +/- 5.7 (SD) ng/dl compared to 12.3 +/- 9.8 ng/dl in the ARB cohort (p = 0.0018, normal ambulatory pALDO 9.4-33.8 ng/dl).

Currently, the detection of initial tumors and recurrent disease is based on evaluation of voided urinary specimens, often followed by cystoscopy. With the high rate of recurrence, cystoscopies are regularly repeated with the aim of halting progression of the disease. For patients, this process is fraught with anxiety, pain and high cost. As a result, intense work is being done in the field of bladder tumor markers with the goal of identifying bladder cancer earlier, both in the initial diagnosis and in recurrences of known tumor. The possibility of identifying a marker that could noninvasively differentiate benign and malignant causes of hematuria, and identify recurrences prior to their pathologic progression is the objective of this area of research. Currently, a large number of tumor markers exist, each scrutinized in both the laboratory and in clinical trials. Here we present many of the most widely used and tested markers. Background details are provided as to the mechanism of detection of malignant cells, the results of recent trials and future directions of study. Some novel modalities for tumor detection are also presented. The next few years will no doubt bring newer markers and lead to the elimination of others.

Bladder cancer represents a major health problem throughout the world, but advances in tumor biomarker development are revolutionizing how physicians diagnose the disease. We previously used an indirect immunoassay to demonstrate that the bladder cancer specific biomarker, BLCA-4, is present in urine samples from patients with bladder cancer, but not in samples from healthy individuals. In this study, a sandwich immunoassay was used to measure BLCA-4 in urine samples from patient populations with various urologic conditions and healthy individuals. Methods. Urine was collected from healthy individuals and from patients with bladder cancer, benign urologic conditions, or prostate cancer. BLCA-4 levels were evaluated by a sandwich immunoassay using two antibodies directed against distinct epitopes on BLCA-4. Results. Using a prospectively determined cutoff of an absorbance unit (OD) of 0.04, 67 of the 75 samples from patients with bladder cancer were positive for BLCA-4, resulting in an assay sensitivity of 89%. Also, 62 of the 65 samples from individuals without bladder cancer were negative for BLCA-4, resulting in an assay specificity of 95%. Conclusions. The high sensitivity and specificity of the sandwich BLCA-4 immunoassay may allow for earlier detection and treatment of disease, thus greatly improving patient care.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0090-4295,1527-9995,,NA,NA,DEC,2005,66,6,,,,NA,1256,1260,,10.1016/j.urolog.2005.07.010,NA,NA,Urology & Nephrology,Urology & Nephrology,NA,WOS:000234130200025,16360453,1395,1,"Highly specific urine-based marker of bladder cancer (Retraction of Urology, vol 66, pg 1256, 2005)",1,highly specific urine-based marker of bladder cancer,highly specific urine-based marker of bladder cancer,TRUE,01-Jul-08,Jun-14,16-Dec-05,2008,2014,2005

Recent works suggest that topological parameters, amino acid properties, chain length and the composition index relate well with protein folding rates, however, sequence order information has seldom been considered as a property for predicting protein folding rates. In this study, amino acid sequence order was used to derive an effective method, based on an extended version of the pseudo-amino acid composition, for predicting protein folding rates without any explicit structural information. Using the jackknife cross validation test, the method was demonstrated on the largest dataset (99 proteins) reported. The method was found to provide a good correlation between the predicted and experimental folding rates. The correlation coefficient is 0.81 (with a highly significant level) and the standard error is 2.46. The reported algorithm was found to perform better than several representative sequence-based approaches using the same dataset. The results indicate that sequence order information is an important determinant of protein folding rates. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
