FXS results from a mutation that causes silencing of the FMR1 gene, which encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein. Patients with FXS exhibit a range of neurological deficits, including motor skill deficits. Here, we have investigated motor skill learning and its synaptic correlates in the fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse. We find that fmr1 KO mice have impaired motor skill learning of a forelimb-reaching task, compared with their wild-type (WT) littermate controls. Electrophysiological recordings from the forelimb region of the primary motor cortex demonstrated reduced, training-induced synaptic strengthening in the trained hemisphere. Moreover, long-term potentiation (LTP) is impaired in the fmr1 KO mouse, and motor skill training does not occlude LTP as it does in the WT mice. Whereas motor skill training induces an increase of synaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluA1), there is a delay in GluA1 increase in the trained hemisphere of the fmr1 KO mice. Using transcranial in vivo multiphoton microscopy, we find that fmr1 KO mice have similar spine density but increased dendritic spine turnover compared with WT mice. Finally, we report that motor skill training-induced formation of dendritic spines is impaired in fmr1 KO mice.

Furthermore, different forms of investments are associated with partly distinct medial prefrontal areas: a region of the dorsal MPFC is uniquely related to the degree of certainty with which a particular self-view is held (one's epistemic investment), whereas a region of the ventral MPFC responds specifically to the importance attached to this self-view (one's emotive investment).

Negative emotionality (NE)-related traits are linked to vulnerability to mood and anxiety disorders; this has fuelled a special interest in examining stable differences in brain morphology associated to these traits. Structural imaging methods including voxel-based morphometry, cortical thickness analysis and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have yielded inconclusive and sometimes contradictory results. This review summarizes the findings reported to date through these methods and discusses them in relation to the functional imaging results. To detect topographic convergence between studies showing positive and, respectively, negative grey matter associations with NE-traits, activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses of VBM studies were performed. Individuals scoring high on NE-related traits show consistent morphological differences in a left-lateralized circuit: higher grey matter volume (GMV) in amygdala and anterior parahippocampal gyrus and lower GMV in the orbitofrontal cortex extending into perigenual anterior cingulate cortex. Most DTI studies indicate reduced white matter integrity in various brain regions and tracts, particularly in the uncinate fasciculus and in cingulum bundle. These results show that the behavioural phenotype associated to NE traits is reflected in structural differences within the cortico-limbic system, suggesting alterations in information processing and transmission. The results are discussed from the perspective of neuron-glia interactions. Future directions are outlined based on recent developments in structural imaging techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Dietary methyl donor supplementation could be able to reverse the negative effects of maternal separation by affecting DNA methylation in the brain. In this study, maternal separation during lactation reduced body weight gain in the female adult offspring without affecting food intake, and altered total and HDL-cholesterol levels. Also, maternal separation induced a cognitive deficit as measured by NORT and an increase in the immobility time in the Porsolt forced swimming test, consistent with increased depression-like behaviour. An 18-week dietary supplementation with methyl donors (choline, betaine, folate and vitamin B12) from postnatal day 60 also reduced body weight without affecting food intake. Some of the deleterious effects induced by maternal separation, such as the abnormal levels of total and HDL-cholesterol, but especially the depression-like behaviour as measured by the Porsolt test, were reversed by methyl donor supplementation. Also, the administration of methyl donors increased total DNA methylation (measured by immunohistochemistry) and affected the expression of insulin receptor in the hippocampus of the adult offspring. However, no changes were observed in the DNA methylation status of insulin receptor and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) promoter regions in the hypothalamus.

As a bubble grows, microeconomic behavior ceases to be constrained by realistic predictions. This contradicts the basic assumption of economics that agents have rational expectations. To examine the neural basis of behavior during bubbles, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants traded shares in a virtual stock exchange with two non-bubble stocks and one bubble stock. The price was largely deflected from the fair price in one of the non-bubble stocks, but not in the other. Their fair prices were specified. The price of the bubble stock showed a large increase and battering, as based on a real stock-market bust. The imaging results revealed modulation of the brain circuits that regulate trade behavior under different market conditions. The premotor cortex was activated only under a market condition in which the price was largely deflected from the fair price specified. During the bubble, brain regions associated with the cognitive processing that supports order decisions were identified. The asset preference that might bias the decision was associated with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The activity of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) was correlated with the score of future time perspective, which would bias the estimation of future price. These regions were deemed to form a distinctive network during the bubble. A functional connectivity analysis showed that the connectivity between the DLPFC and the IPL was predominant compared with other connectivities only during the bubble. These findings indicate that uncertain and unstable market conditions changed brain modes in traders. These brain mechanisms might lead to a loss of control caused by wishful thinking, and to microeconomic bubbles that expand, on the macroscopic scale, toward bust. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Immunohistochemical analysis of the development and plasticity of these inhibitory inputs is difficult because PV expression is low in young animals and strongly influenced by neuronal activity. Moreover, the synaptic boutons that PV neurons form onto each other cannot be distinguished from the innervated cell bodies by immunostaining for this protein because it is present throughout the cells. These problems call for the availability of a synaptic, activity-independent marker for PV+ inhibitory boutons that is expressed before sensitive period onset. We investigated whether synaptotagmin-2 (Syt2) fulfills these properties in the visual cortex. Syt2 is a synaptic vesicle protein involved in fast Ca2+ dependent neurotransmitter release. Its mRNA expression follows a pattern similar to that of PV throughout the brain and is present in 30-40% of hippocampal PV expressing basket cells. Up to now, no quantitative analyses of Syt2 expression in the visual cortex have been carried out.Methodology/Principal Findings: We used immunohistochemistry to analyze colocalization of Syt2 with multiple interneuron markers including vesicular GABA transporter VGAT, calbindin, calretinin, somatostatin and PV in the primary visual cortex of mice during development and after dark-rearing.Conclusions/Significance: We show that in the adult visual cortex Syt2 is only found in inhibitory, VGAT positive boutons. Practically all Syt2 positive boutons also contain PV and vice versa. During development, Syt2 expression can be detected in synaptic boutons prior to PV and in contrast to PV expression, Syt2 is not down-regulated by dark-rearing. These properties of Syt2 make it an excellent marker for analyzing the development and plasticity of perisomatic inhibitory innervations onto both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7","0","0","6","0","7",NA,NA,"1932-6203",NA,NA,"WOS:000305341000032","22539967","J",1,1,"Nature","2009","12-Nov","220","8485","mice","PTX affects on spike bias","YES","PTX","between","spike bias","Japan","potentially serious"

After training participants were tested with a completely new set of objects as well as with two variants of the trained object set, namely an orientation change and a change of the exact exemplar shown. Both manipulations led to a decrease in performance compared to the original picture set. Nevertheless, performance with the manipulated versions of the trained stimuli was better than performance with the completely new set, at least when only one manipulation was performed. Amount of transfer to new images of an object was related to perceptual similarity, but not to pixel overlap or to measurements of similarity in the different layers of a popular hierarchical object recognition model (HMAX). Thus, object learning generalizes only partially over changes in exemplars and orientation, which is consistent with the tuning properties of neurons in object-selective cortical regions and the role of perceptual similarity in these representations.

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit impairments in regulating their visual attention, but little is known about how such impairments develop over time. This prospective longitudinal study is the first to describe the development of components of visual attention, including engaging, sustaining, and disengaging attention, in infants at high-risk of developing ASD (each with an older sibling with ASD). Non-sibling controls and high-risk infant siblings were filmed at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, and 36 months of age as they engaged in play with small, easily graspable toys. Duration of time spent looking at toy targets before moving the hand toward the target and the duration of time spent looking at the target after grasp were measured. At 36 months of age, an independent, gold standard diagnostic assessment for ASD was conducted for all participants. As predicted, infant siblings subsequently diagnosed with ASD were distinguished by prolonged latency to disengage ('sticky attention') by 12 months of age, and continued to show this characteristic at 15, 18, and 24 months of age. The results are discussed in relation to how the development of visual attention may impact later cognitive outcomes of children diagnosed with ASD. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Although a variety of approaches have been proposed, we will mainly focus on cognitive training interventions, in which learners repeatedly perform cognitive tasks to improve their cognitive abilities. In this review article, we propose that the learning process during the cognitive training can be facilitated by an assistive system monitoring cognitive workloads using electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers, and the brain connectome approach can provide additional valuable biomarkers for facilitating leaners learning processes. For the purpose, we will introduce studies on the cognitive training interventions, EEG biomarkers for cognitive workload, and human brain connectome. As cognitive overload and mental fatigue would reduce or even eliminate gains of cognitive training interventions, a real-time monitoring of cognitive workload can facilitate the learning process by flexibly adjusting difficulty levels of the training task. Moreover, cognitive training interventions should have effects on brain sub networks, not on a single brain region, and graph theoretical network metrics quantifying topological architecture of the brain network can differentiate with respect to individual cognitive states as well as to different individuals' cognitive abilities, suggesting that the connectome is a valuable approach for tracking the learning progress.

Stimulus displays consisted of four patches of moving dots briefly (500 ms) presented simultaneously, one patch in each visual quadrant. The coherence level was varied in the target patch from near threshold to high, while the other three patches contained only noise. The participants judged whether coherent motion was present or absent in the target patch. To guarantee central fixation, a secondary RSVP digit-detection task was performed at fixation. Over six training sessions subjects learned to detect coherent motion in a predefined quadrant (i.e. the learned location). Half of our subjects were randomly assigned to the feedback group, where they received informative feedback after each response during training, whereas the other group received non-informative feedback during training that a response button was pressed. We investigated whether the presence of informative feedback during training had an influence on the learning success and on the resulting BOLD response. Behavioral data of 24 subjects showed improved performance with increasing practice. Informative feedback promoted learning for motion displays with high coherence levels, whereas it had little effect on learning for displays with near-threshold coherence levels. Learning enhanced fMRI responses in early visual cortex and motion-sensitive area MT+ and these changes were most pronounced for high coherence levels. Activation in the insular and cingulate cortex was mainly influenced by coherence level and trained location. We conclude that feedback modulates behavioral performance and, to a lesser extent, brain activation in areas responsible for monitoring perceptual learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be involved in these key neuronal processes by subserving events such as presynaptic vesicle movement, postsynaptic glutamate receptors trafficking and dendritic spines morphogenesis. Actin cytoskeleton dynamics and structure underlying such cellular events can be regulated by extracellular signals through its regulatory proteins. Recent findings show that the actin cytoskeleton and its regulatory proteins are needed for memory formation and extinction in different organisms throughout the phyla from invertebrates such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila to mammalians. The actin cytoskeleton and its regulatory proteins participate in the formation of various types of memories that are subserved by different neurons and brain regions.

Also pregenual ACC (pgACC) is linked to loss and pain, being activated by sad thoughts and regrets. Lateral habenula (LHb) is stimulated by predicted and received pain, discomfort, aversive outcome, loss. Its chronic stimulation makes us feel worse/low and gradually stops us choosing and moving for the suboptimal or punished choices, by direct and indirect (via rostromedial tegmental nucleus, RMTg) inhibition of dorsal raphe nucleus (DAN) and VTA/SNc. The response selectivity of LHb neurons suggests their cortical input from affective and cognitive evaluative regions that make expectations about bad, unpleasant or suboptimal outcomes. Based on these facts I predicted direct dACC, pgACC and Al projections to LHb, which form part of an adversity processing circuit that learns to avoid bad outcomes by suppressing dopamine and serotonin signal. To test this connectivity I used Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). I found dACC, pgACC, Al and caudolateral OFC (cIOFC) projections to LHb. I predicted no corticohabenular projections from the reward processing regions: medial OFC (mOFC) and ventral ACC (vACC) because both respond most strongly to good, high valued stimuli and outcomes, inducing dopamine and serotonin release. This lack of LHb projections was confirmed for vACC and likely for rnOFC. The surprising findings were the corticohabenular projections from the cognitive prefrontal cortex regions, known for flexible reasoning, planning and combining whatever information are relevant for reaching current goals. I propose that the prefrontohabenular projections provide a teaching signal for value-based choice behavior, to learn to deselect, avoid or inhibit the potentially harmful, low valued or wrong choices, goals, strategies, predictions and ways of doing things, to prevent bad or suboptimal consequences.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"1662-5161",NA,NA,"WOS:000343749200001","25386128","J",1,3,"NN","2010 (13)","11","1354","http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v13/n11/pdf/nn.2654.pdf","zebrafish","genetic inactivation, behavior","YES","genetic inactivation","between","behavioral","Japan","potentially serious, ook vb van voormeting, nameting apart"

It allows neurons to express light-sensitive genes that enable the identification, dissection, and manipulation of specific neural populations and their connections in the tissues and organs of awake animals with unprecedented spatial and temporal precision. Light-sensitive genes chiefly including the genetically targeted light-gated channels channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR) cause intracellular ion flow during optical illumination. Subsequently, the neurons undergo a series of changes resulting from membrane depolarization or hyperpolarization. To date, there are many published research articles and reviews that describe this new technology; however, few of the reports concern its application to neuropsychiatric diseases.

In the present study, we assessed the effects of intrastriatal infusions on BDNF (1-100 ng/hemisphere) in mice performing an operant strategy set-shifting task that required the animals to eliminate a visual cue-based strategy and adopt a new egocentric spatial response strategy to achieve rewards. Exogenous BDNF administration facilitated the acquisition of strategy shifting by minimizing response perseveration to the previously acquired strategy and this effect resemble an inverted-U shaped dose response pattern. Faster acquisition of strategy switching in BDNF-infused animals was dependent upon the activation of striatal trkB receptors. Moreover, activation of mGluR2/3 receptors by the selective group II metabotropic receptor agonist LY379268 abolished BDNF-induced cognitive enhancement suggesting the involvement of presynaptic glutamatergic. activity. Assessment of striatal glutamate dynamics using electrochemical recordings indicated that local application of BDNF directly induces glutamate release by activating presynaptic trkB receptors on glutamatergic terminals, and this effect followed a bell-shaped dose response pattern similar to strategy shifting performance. These data suggest that activation of BDNF-trkB signaling in the dorsal striatum improves strategy switching by effectively minimizing response conflicts, and this effect primarily involves facilitation of glutamatergic transmission.

We investigated the coexpression of TRPM8 and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and VGLUT2 in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and the dental pulp before and after inducing pulpal inflammation. Many TRPM8+ neurons in the TG and axons in the dental pulp expressed VGLUT2, while none expressed VGLUT1.

To characterize antidepressant-like effects mice underwent behavioral characterization. In a second experiment dosages of pramipexole shown to be effective were used and candidate brain regions including hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum were analyzed for levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), noradrenaline and dopamine and their metabolites as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to investigate possible neurochemical correlates of behavioral changes. Whereas acute treatment with pramipexole resulted in antidepressive-like effects in the Porsolt Forced Swim Test, Novel Cage Test, Openfield Test and Dark-light-Box Test and a tendency but insignificant effect in the Tail Suspension Test, chronic treatment did not show significant effects in any of the behavioral analyses. Neurochemical analyses revealed a highly significant effect on dopaminergic metabolites in the striatum as well as a moderate transient modulation of the serotonergic system in the hippocampus. BDNF levels were not affected by any dosage and treatment regime in any brain region investigated. In conclusion, the present data substantiate antidepressive effects of pramipexole and indicate a contribution of the dopaminergic and serotonergic metabolism in these effects, but argue against an eminent role of BDNF.

The CRF receptor is widely expressed across a variety of cell types, impeding progress toward understanding the contribution of specific CRF-containing neurons to fear dysregulation. We used a unique CRF-Cre driver transgenic mouse line to remove floxed GABA(A)alpha 1 subunits specifically from CRF neurons [CRF-GABA(A)alpha 1 KO]. This process resulted in mice with decreased GABA(A)alpha 1 expression only in CRF neurons and increased CRF mRNA within the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. These mice show normal locomotor and pain responses and no difference in depressive-like behavior or Pavlovian fear conditioning. However, CRF-GABA(A)alpha 1 KO increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired extinction of conditioned fear, coincident with an increase in plasma corticosterone concentration. These behavioral impairments were rescued with systemic or BNST infusion of the CRF antagonist R121919. Infusion of Zolpidem, a GABA(A)alpha 1-preferring benzodiazepine-site agonist, into the BNST of the CRF-GABA(A)alpha 1 KO was ineffective at decreasing anxiety. Electrophysiological findings suggest a disruption in inhibitory current may play a role in these changes.

Psychophysical results indicated that temporal expectation enhanced the contrast sensitivity of visual targets. A diffusion model indicated that rhythmic temporal expectation modulated the signal-to-noise gain of visual processing.

Switch like, rather than graded changes, illustrate par excellence how epigenetic events perpetuate altered activity states in the absence of the initial cue. They occur from early neural development to maturation and can give rise to distinct diseases upon deregulation. Many neurodevelopmental genes harbor bivalently marked chromatin domains, states of balanced inhibition, which guide dynamic ""ON or OFF"" decisions once the balance is tilted in response to developmental or environmental cues. Examples discussed in this review include neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) into progenitors and beyond, activation of Kiss1 at puberty onset, and early experience dependent programming of Avp, a major stress gene. At the genome-scale, genomic imprinting can be epigenetically switched on or off at select genes in a tightly controlled temporospatial manner and provides a versatile mechanism for dosage regulation of genes with important roles in stem cell quiescence or differentiation. Moreover, retrotransposition in neural progenitors provides an intriguing example of an epigenetic-like switch, which is stimulated by bivalently marked neurodevelopmental genes and possibly results in increased genomic flexibility regarding unprecedented challenge.

Environmental factors like perinatal infection, malnutrition and trauma can increase the risk of the heterogeneous, multifactorial and polygenic disorders, autism and schizophrenia. Conversely, discrete genetic anomalies are involved in Down, Rett and Fragile X syndromes, tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis, the less familiar Phelan-McDermid, Sotos, Kleefstra, Coffin-Lowry and ""ATRX"" syndromes, and the disorders of imprinting, Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes. NDDs have been termed ""synaptopathies"" in reference to structural and functional disturbance of synaptic plasticity, several involve abnormal Ras-Kinase signalling (""rasopathies""), and many are characterized by disrupted cerebral connectivity and an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory transmission. However, at a different level of integration, NDDs are accompanied by aberrant ""epigenetic"" regulation of processes critical for normal and orderly development of the brain. Epigenetics refers to potentially-heritable (by mitosis and/or meiosis) mechanisms controlling gene expression without changes in DNA sequence. In certain NDDs, prototypical epigenetic processes of DNA methylation and covalent histone marking are impacted. Conversely, others involve anomalies in chromatin-modelling, mRNA splicing/editing, mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis and/or the regulatory actions of small nucleolar RNAs and micro-RNAs. Since epigenetic mechanisms are modifiable, this raises the hope of novel therapy, though questions remain concerning efficacy and safety. The above issues are critically surveyed in this review, which advocates a broad-based epigenetic framework for understanding and ultimately treating a diverse assemblage of NDDs (""epigenopathies"") lying at the interface of genetic, developmental and environmental processes.This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Neurodevelopmental Disorders'.

Successful acoustic communication requires the ability to extract meaning from those sounds, even when degraded. One strategy used by the auditory system is to harness high-level contextual cues to modulate the perception of incoming sounds. An ideal substrate for this process is the massive set of top-down projections emanating from virtually every level of the auditory system. In this review, we provide a molecular and circuit-level description of one of the largest of these pathways: the auditory corticocollicular pathway. While its functional role remains to be fully elucidated, activation of this projection system can rapidly and profoundly change the tuning of neurons in the inferior colliculus. Several specific issues are reviewed. First, we describe the complex heterogeneous anatomical organization of the corticocollicular pathway, with particular emphasis on the topography of the pathway. We also review the laminar origin of the corticocollicular projection and discuss known physiological and morphological differences between subsets of corticocollicular cells. Finally, we discuss recent findings about the molecular micro-organization of the inferior colliculus and how it interfaces with corticocollicular termination patterns. Given the assortment of molecular tools now available to the investigator, it is hoped that his review will help guide future research on the role of this pathway in normal hearing.

As such, it provides an analytic window to evaluate how neural activity relevant to pitch undergo transformation from early sensory to later cognitive stages of processing in a well coordinated hierarchical network that is subject to experience-dependent plasticity. We review recent evidence of language experience-dependent effects in pitch processing based on comparisons of native vs. nonnative speakers of a tonal language from electrophysiological recordings in the auditory brainstem and auditory cortex. We present evidence that shows enhanced representation of linguistically-relevant pitch dimensions or features at both the brainstem and cortical levels with a stimulus-dependent preferential activation of the right hemisphere in native speakers of a tone language. We argue that neural representation of pitch-relevant information in the brainstem and early sensory level processing in the auditory cortex is shaped by the perceptual salience of domain-specific features. While both stages of processing are shaped by language experience, neural representations are transformed and fundamentally different at each biological level of abstraction. The representation of pitch relevant information in the brainstem is more fine-grained spectrotemporally as it reflects sustained neural phase-locking to pitch relevant periodicities contained in the stimulus. In contrast, the cortical pitch relevant neural activity reflects primarily a series of transient temporal neural events synchronized to certain temporal attributes of the pitch contour. We argue that experience-dependent enhancement of pitch representation for Chinese listeners most likely reflects an interaction between higher-level cognitive processes and early sensory-level processing to improve representations of behaviorally-relevant features that contribute optimally to perception. It is our view that long-term experience shapes this adaptive process wherein the top-down connections provide selective gating of inputs to both cortical and subcortical structures to enhance neural responses to specific behaviorally-relevant attributes of the stimulus. A theoretical framework for a neural network is proposed involving coordination between local, feedforward, and feedback components that can account for experience-dependent enhancement of pitch representations at multiple levels of the auditory pathway. The ability to record brainstem and cortical pitch relevant responses concurrently may provide a new window to evaluate the online interplay between feedback, feedforward, and local intrinsic components in the hierarchical processing of pitch relevant information.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","0","0","1","0","1",NA,NA,"0814-6039","1839-2571",NA,"WOS:000347787900002",NA,"J",1,3,"NN","2010 (13)","2","253","","ferrets","selectively killing the neurons using chromophore-targeted laser photolysis","YES","number of neurons in layers 3 and 5","within","behavioral","UK","not so serious p.088 vs < .001"

Therefore, understanding dHb function is important for understanding the neural basis of fear. In zebrafish, the dHb receives inputs from the mitral cells (MCs) of the olfactory bulb (OB) [6], and odors can trigger distinct behaviors (e. g., feeding, courtship, alarm) [7]. However, it is unclear how the dHb processes olfactory information and how these computations relate to behavior. In this study, we demonstrate that the odor responses in the dHb are asymmetric and spatially organized despite the unorganized OB inputs. Moreover, we show that the spontaneous dHb activity is not random but structured into functionally and spatially organized clusters of neurons, which reflects the favored states of the dHb network. These dHb clusters are also preserved during odor stimulation and govern olfactory responses.

This functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) study now contrasted the impact of aversive and appetitive motivation on episodic long-term memory. Cue pictures predicted monetary reward or punishment in alternating experimental blocks. One day later, episodic memory for the cue pictures was tested. We also investigated how the neural processing of appetitive and aversive motivation and episodic memory were modulated by dopaminergic mechanisms. To that end, participants were selected on the basis of their genotype for a variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism of the dopamine transporter (DAT) gene. The resulting groups were carefully matched for the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene. Recognition memory for cues from both motivational categories was enhanced in participants homozygous for the 10-repeat allele of the DAT, the functional effects of which are not known yet, but not in heterozygous subjects. In comparison with heterozygous participants, 10-repeat homozygous participants also showed increased striatal activity for anticipation of motivational outcomes compared to neutral outcomes. In a subsequent memory analysis, encoding activity in striatum and hippocampus was found to be higher for later recognized items in 10-repeat homozygotes compared to 9/10-repeat heterozygotes. These findings suggest that processing of appetitive and aversive motivation in the human striatum involve the dopaminergic system and that dopamine plays a role in memory for both types of motivational information. In accordance with animal studies, these data support the idea that encoding of motivational events depends on dopaminergic processes in the hippocampus. (C) 2013 The Authors.

However, the involvement of mPFC in estimation of value during decision-making suggests that it might play a similar role in memory. We investigated whether mPFC activity reflects the subjective value of elements in imagined scenarios. Participants in an MRI scanner imagined scenarios comprising a spatial context, a physiological state of need (e.g., thirst), and two items that could be congruent (e.g., drink) or incongruent (e.g., food) with the state of need. Memory for the scenarios was tested outside the scanner. Our manipulation of subjective value by imagined need was verified by increased subjective ratings of value for congruent items and improved subsequent memory for them. Consistent with our hypothesis, fMRI signal in mPFC reflected the modulation of an item's subjective value by the imagined physiological state, suggesting the mPFC selectively tracked subjective value within our imagination paradigm. Further analyses showed uncorrected effects in non-mPFC regions, including increased activity in the insula when imagining states of need, the caudate nucleus when imagining congruent items, and the anterior hippocampus/amygdala when imagining subsequently remembered items.

In these cells TRPC3 channel opening requires stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1, activation of which can also lead to the induction of long term depression (LTD), which underlies cerebellar motor learning. LTD induction requires protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase G (PKG) activation, and although PKC phosphorylation targets are well established, virtually nothing is known about PKG targets in LTD. Because TRPC3 channels are inhibited after phosphorylation by PKC and PKG in expression systems, we examined whether native TRPC3 channels in Purkinje cells are a target for PKG or PKC, thereby contributing to cerebellar LTD. We find that in Purkinje cells, activation of TRPC3-dependent currents is not inhibited by conventional PKC or PKG to any significant extent and that inhibition of these kinases does not significantly impact on TRPC3-mediated currents either.

Though the current knowledge suggests that the long-term impact of maternal obesity on the offspring's health may be substantial, the outcomes of maternal obesity over the lifespan have not been quantified, and the molecular changes induced by maternal obesity remain poorly characterized. We hypothesize that maternal insulin resistance and reduced placental glucocorticoid catabolism, leading to oxidative stress, may damage the DNA, either in its structure (telomere shortening) or in its function (via epigenetic changes), resulting in altered gene expression/repair, disease during life, and pathological ageing.

Selective optogenetic inhibition of SOM responses blocked desynchronization and decorrelation, demonstrating that direct cholinergic activation of SOM neurons is necessary for this phenomenon. Optogenetic inhibition of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing neurons did not block desynchronization, despite these neurons being activated at high levels of cholinergic drive.

While several neuroimaging studies have linked SAD with hyperreactivity in limbic brain regions when exposed to emotional faces, little is known about habituation in both the amygdala and neocortical regulation areas. 15 untreated SAD patients and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during repeated blocks of facial emotion (EDT) and object discrimination tasks (ODT). Emotion processing networks were defined by a task-related contrast (EDT > ODT). Linear regression was employed for assessing habituation effects in these regions. In both groups, the employed paradigm robustly activated the emotion processing and regulation network, including the amygdalae and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Statistically significant habituation effects were found in the amygdalae, OFC, and pulvinar thalamus of SAD patients. No such habituation was found in healthy controls. Concurrent habituation in the medial OFC and the amygdalae of SAD patients as shown in this study suggests intact functional integrity and successful short-term down-regulation of neural activation in brain areas responsible for emotion processing. Initial hyperactivation may be explained by an insufficient habituation to new stimuli during the first seconds of exposure.

However, although GRP immunoreactivity has been detected in the spinal dorsal horn, there is debate about whether this originates from primary afferents or local excitatory interneurons. We therefore examined the relation of GRP immunoreactivity to that seen with antibodies that label primary afferent or excitatory interneuron terminals. We tested the specificity of the GRP antibody by preincubating with peptides with which it could potentially cross-react. We also examined tissue from a mouse line in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed under control of the GRP promoter.Results: GRP immunoreactivity was seen in both primary afferent and non-primary glutamatergic axon terminals in the superficial dorsal horn. However, immunostaining was blocked by pre-incubation of the antibody with substance P, which is present at high levels in many nociceptive primary afferents. EGFP(+) cells in the GRP-EGFP mouse did not express Pax2, and their axons contained the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), indicating that they are excitatory interneurons. In most cases, their axons were also GRP-immunoreactive. Multiple-labelling immunocytochemical studies indicated that these cells did not express either of the preprotachykinin peptides, and that they generally lacked protein kinase C gamma, which is expressed by a subset of the excitatory interneurons in this region.Conclusions: These results show that GRP is expressed by a distinct population of excitatory interneurons in laminae I-II that are likely to be involved in the itch pathway.

However, nicotine concentrations that are routinely self-administered by smokers are predicted to desensitize high-affinity alpha 4 beta 2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in seconds. Thus, how physiologically relevant nicotine concentrations persistently activate VTA DAergic neurons is unknown. Here we show that nicotine can directly and robustly increase the firing frequency of VTA DAergic neurons for several minutes. In mouse midbrain slices, 300 nM nicotine elicited a persistent inward current in VTA DAergic neurons that was blocked by alpha-conotoxin MII[H9A; L15A], a selective antagonist of nAChRs containing the alpha 6 subunit. alpha-conotoxin MII[H9A; L15A] also significantly reduced the long-lasting increase in DAergic neuronal activity produced by low concentrations of nicotine. In addition, nicotine failed to significantly activate VTA DAergic neurons in mice that did not express either alpha 4 or alpha 6 nAChR subunits. Conversely, selective activation of nAChRs containing the alpha 4 subunit in knock-in mice expressing a hypersensitive version of these receptors yielded a biphasic response to nicotine consisting of an acute desensitizing increase in firing frequency followed by a sustained increase that lasted several minutes and was sensitive to alpha-conotoxin MII[H9A; L15A].

However, the mechanism underlying 1Hz PF-LTP remains unclear because none of the known events is related to each other. Here, we demonstrated that 1 Hz PF-LTP requires postsynaptic cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha (cPLA(2)alpha)/arachidonic acid (AA) signaling and presynaptic endocannabinoid receptors. Using patch-clamp recording in cerebellar slices, we found that 1 Hz PF-LTP was abolished in cPLA(2)alpha-knock-out mice. This deficit was effectively rescued by the conjunction of 1 Hz PF stimulation and the local application of AA. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol and the retrograde activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) were also involved in 1 Hz LTP because it was blocked by the hydrolysis of 2-AG or by inhibiting CB1Rs. The amount of NO released was detected using an NO electrode in cultured granule cells and PF terminals. Our results showed that the activation of CB1Rs at PF terminals activated NO synthetase and promoted NO production. The 1 Hz PF-stimuli evoked limited NO, but 100 Hz PF stimulation generated a large amount. Therefore, 1Hz PF-LTP, distinct from classical postsynaptically expressed plasticity, requires concurrent presynaptic and postsynaptic activity.

Selective activation of LC-NE neurons produced cortical electroencephalography (EEG) activation under continuous deep isoflurane anesthesia. Specifically, LC-NE activation reduced burst suppression in EEG and drove a rightward shift in peak EEG frequency with reduced delta EEG power and increased. EEG power, measures of cortical arousal. LC-NE activation also accelerated behavioral emergence from deep isoflurane anesthesia; this was prevented with beta or alpha 1 noradrenergic antagonists. Moreover, these adrenoreceptor antagonists alone were sufficient to markedly potentiate anesthetic duration when delivered centrally or peripherally. Induction of anesthesia also was retarded by LC-NE activation. Our results demonstrate that the LC-NE system strongly modulates the anesthetic state, and that changes in LC-NE neurotransmission alone can affect the emergence from isoflurane general anesthesia.

The LC is the primary source of central norepinephrine (C-NE) and nearly the exclusive source of cortical norepinephrine. Normally activated by novel or salient stimuli, the AC initially inhibits the SNS reflexively, lowering peripheral norepinephrine and activates the LC, increasing C-NE.

When we aligned data to the onset of the (late-appearing) state that dominates during the time period in which single-neuron firing is correlated to taste palatability, the apparent ramp in stimulus-aligned choice-related firing was shown to be a much more precipitous coherent jump. This jump in choice-related firing resembled a step function more than it did the output of a standard (ramping) decision-making model, and provided a robust prediction of decision latency in single trials. Together, these results demonstrate that activity related to naturalistic consumption decisions emerges nearly instantaneously in cortical ensembles.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"0270-6474",NA,NA,"WOS:000368355100004","26791199","J",1,5,"NN","2010 (13)","","158","","rats","","YES","nasal infusions made subjects temporarily anosmic vs vehicle infusions","between","behavioral","US","not serious"

We measured modulations in phase-coherent alpha oscillations from superficial frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices using the event-related optical signal (EROS), a measure of neuronal activity affording high spatiotemporal resolution, along with concurrently recorded EEG, while participants performed a visual target detection task. The pretarget alpha oscillations measured with EEG and EROS from posterior areas were larger for subsequently undetected targets, supporting alpha's inhibitory role. Using EROS, we localized brain correlates of these awareness-related alpha oscillations measured at the scalp to the cuneus and precuneus. Crucially, EROS alpha suppression correlated with posterior EEG alpha power across participants. Sorting the EROS data based on EEG alpha power quartiles to investigate alpha modulators revealed that suppression of posterior alpha was preceded by increased activity in regions of the dorsal attention network and decreased activity in regions of the cingulo-opercular network. Cross-correlations revealed the temporal dynamics of activity within these preparatory networks before posterior alpha modulation.

Contradictorily, ERP C1 changes associated with perceptual learning are cited as evidence for training-induced plasticity in the early visual cortex. However, C1 can be top-down modulated, which suggests the possibility that C1 changes may result from top-down modulation of the early visual cortex by high-level perceptual learning. To single out the potential top-down impact, we trained observers with a peripheral orientation discrimination task and measured C1 changes at an untrained diagonal quadrant location where learning transfer was previously known to be significant. Our assumption was that any C1 changes at this untrained location would indicate top-down modulation of the early visual cortex, rather than plasticity in the early visual cortex. The expected learning transfer was indeed accompanied with significant C1 changes. Moreover, C1 changes were absent in an untrained shape discrimination task with the same stimuli. We conclude that ERP C1 can be top-down modulated in a task-specific manner by high-level perceptual learning, so that C1 changes may not necessarily indicate plasticity in the early visual cortex.

Here, we have systematically investigated the presence of a spatial channel of processing at a range of spatial frequencies using a psychophysical forced-choice technique and obtained the corresponding pupil responses in the blindfield of 19 hemianopic patients. In addition, in 13 cases we determined the pupil responses in a sighted field location that matched the blindfield eccentricities. Our findings demonstrate that blindfield pupil responses are similar to those for the sighted field, but attenuated in amplitude.

Here, we investigated the extent to which initial learning and stable performance of a spatial navigation task modulates functional connectivity between subregions of hippocampus and striatum. Subjects actively navigated through a virtual water maze environment and used visual cues to learn the position of a fixed spatial location. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected before and after virtual water maze navigation in two scan sessions conducted 1 week apart, with a behavior-only training session in between. There was a large significant reduction in the time taken to intercept the target location during scan session 1 and a small significant reduction during the behavior-only training session. No further reduction was observed during scan session 2. This indicates that scan session 1 represented initial learning and scan session 2 represented stable performance. We observed an increase in functional connectivity between left posterior hippocampus and left dorsal caudate that was specific to scan session 1. Importantly, the magnitude of the increase in functional connectivity was correlated with offline gains in task performance. Our findings suggest cooperative interaction occurs between posterior hippocampus and dorsal caudate during awake rest following the initial phase of spatial navigation learning.

These offline improvements were linked to both replay of task-related ensembles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and temporal shifts that more tightly bound motor cortical ensembles to movements; such offline gains and temporal shifts were not evident with sleep restriction. Interestingly, replay was linked to the coincidence of slow-wave events and bursts of spindle activity. Neurons that experienced the most consistent replay also underwent the most significant temporal shift and binding to the motor task. Significantly, replay and the associated performance gains after sleep only occurred when animals first learned the skill; continued practice during later stages of learning (i.e., after motor kinematics had stabilized) did not show evidence of replay.

As it relates to higher cortical functions, such as language, in humans, studies performed in nonhuman primates are less relevant. By using subdural electrodes implanted for presurgical evaluation, we developed an hi vivo electrical tract-tracing technique of cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs). Cortico-cortical connections could be traced by applying repetitive single-pulse electrical stimuli to a part of the cortices and recording evoked cortical potentials from adjacent and remote cortical regions by averaging electrocorticogram time-locked to stimulus onset. This technique has contributed to the understanding of human cortico-cortical networks involved in higher brain functions, such as language, praxis, and higher motor control. Establishing a CCEP connectivity map in the MINI standard space is also of academic importance, since a standardized CCEP connectivity map would provide a substantial reference for noninvasive network analyses. In addition to its importance in basic systems neuroscience, this method, in combination with conventional cortical mapping, could be used to clinically map functional brain systems by tracking cortico-cortical connections among functional cortical regions in individual patients. This approach may help identify the cortico-cortical network of a given function within the context of pathology and any resultant plasticity of brain systems. In relation to epileptogenicity, as CCEPs can be used as a measure of regional cortical excitability, stimulating the epileptic focus and recording CCEPs in adjacent areas could help evaluate cortical excitability at and around the focus.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","1","0","1","0","2",NA,NA,"1881-6096","1344-8129",NA,"BCI:BCI201200662039","22941836","J",1,1,"NN","2009 (12)","1","85","","human","TMS, EEG, behavior","YES","TMS over FEF vs control site","within","behavioral","Japan","potentially serious: within-subject bars not informative about the interaction"

The visual density of the targeting environment was manipulated by the presence or absence of friendly soldiers.Results: RoboLeader, when perfectly reliable, was helpful in reducing the overall mission times. The type of RoboLeader imperfection (false-alarm vs. miss prone) affected operators' performance of tasks involving visual scanning (target detection, route editing, and situation awareness). There was a consistent effect of visual density (clutter of the visual scene) for multiple performance measures. Participants' attentional control and video gaming experience affected their overall multitasking performance. In both experiments, participants with greater spatial ability consistently outperformed their low-spatial-ability counterparts in tasks that required effective visual scanning.Conclusion: Intelligent agents, such as RoboLeader, can benefit the overall human-robot teaming performance. However, the effects of type of agent unreliability, tasking requirements, and individual differences have complex effects on human-agent interaction.Application: The current results will facilitate the implementation of robots in military settings and will provide useful data to designs of systems for multirobot control.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8","0","0","0","0","8",NA,NA,"0018-7208",NA,NA,"WOS:000302009200001","22624284","J",1,1,"Neuron","2009","16-Jul","132","63-1","human","BOLD, training","YES","dual-task vs single-task","within","BOLD","US","unclear"

Cognitive evolution has been explained at the proximate level by shifts in absolute and relative brain volume and at the ultimate level by differences in social and dietary complexity. However, no study has integrated the experimental and phylogenetic approach at the scale required to rigorously test these explanations. Instead, previous research has largely relied on various measures of brain size as proxies for cognitive abilities. We experimentally evaluated these major evolutionary explanations by quantitatively comparing the cognitive performance of 567 individuals representing 36 species on two problem-solving tasks measuring self-control. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that absolute brain volume best predicted performance across species and accounted for considerably more variance than brain volume controlling for body mass. This result corroborates recent advances in evolutionary neurobiology and illustrates the cognitive consequences of cortical reorganization through increases in brain volume. Within primates, dietary breadth but not social group size was a strong predictor of species differences in self-control. Our results implicate robust evolutionary relationships between dietary breadth, absolute brain volume, and self-control. These findings provide a significant first step toward quantifying the primate cognitive phenome and explaining the process of cognitive evolution.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"41","0","0","32","0","41",NA,NA,"0027-8424",NA,NA,"WOS:000336168100011","24753565","J",1,3,"Science","2009","01-May","647","5927","human","BOLD","YES","self-control vs. non self-control","between","BOLD beta's","US","data suggest: not serious"

Here we asked whether the anatomical features of individual human brains could be used to predict the fundamental preferences of human choosers. To that end, we quantified the risk attitudes of human decision-makers using standard economic tools and quantified the gray matter cortical volume in all brain areas using standard neurobiological tools. Our whole-brain analysis revealed that the gray matter volume of a region in the right posterior parietal cortex was significantly predictive of individual risk attitudes. Participants with higher gray matter volume in this region exhibited less risk aversion. To test the robustness of this finding we examined a second group of participants and used econometric tools to test the ex ante hypothesis that gray matter volume in this area predicts individual risk attitudes. Our finding was confirmed in this second group. Our results, while being silent about causal relationships, identify what might be considered the first stable biomarker for financial risk-attitude. If these results, gathered in a population of midlife northeast American adults, hold in the general population, they will provide constraints on the possible neural mechanisms underlying risk attitudes. The results will also provide a simple measurement of risk attitudes that could be easily extracted from abundance of existing medical brain scans, and could potentially provide a characteristic distribution of these attitudes for policy makers.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2","0","0","1","0","2",NA,NA,"0270-6474",NA,NA,"WOS:000341766900014","25209279","J",1,3,"Science","2009","01-May","647","5927","human","BOLD","YES","self-control vs. non self-control","between","BOLD beta's","US","data suggest: not serious"
