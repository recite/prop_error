The genotype AA of the rs4730153 SNP was significantly associated with fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance) after adjustment for gender, age, BMI and waist circumference. The obese individuals carrying the CC genotype of the rs11977021 SNP showed higher circulating levels of fasting proinsulin after adjustment for the same variables. The genotype AA of the rs4730153 SNP seems to be protective from CV-risk either estimated by Framingham or SCORE charts in general population; and in obese and non-obese individuals.

Adipose tissue plays a very important endocrine role, secreting different molecules that affect body physiology. In obesity, this function is altered, leading to a dysfunctional production of several factors, known as adipocytokines. This process has been linked to various comorbidities associated with obesity, such as carcinogenesis. In fact, several classical adipocytokines with increased levels in obesity have been demonstrated to exert a pro-carcinogenic role, including leptin, TNF-, IL-6 and resistin, whereas others like adiponectin, with decreased levels in obesity, might have an anti-carcinogenic function. In this expanding field, new proteomic techniques and approaches have allowed the identification of novel adipocytokines, a number of which exhibit an altered production in obesity and type 2 diabetes and thus are related to adiposity. Many of these novel adipocytokines have also been identified in various tumour types, such as that of the breast, liver or endometrium, thereby increasing the list of potential contributors to carcinogenesis. This review is focused on the regulation of these novel adipocytokines by obesity, including apelin, endotrophin, FABP4, lipocalin 2, omentin-1, visfatin, chemerin, ANGPTL2 or osteopontin, emphasizing its involvement in tumorigenesis.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1467-7881","1467-789X",NA,NA,NA,"APR",2016,"17","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"361","376",NA,"10.1111/obr.12377",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000372002400005",26914773,1,"1 no 6"

However, it was subsequently reported to be expressed in almost every tissue of the human body, with visceral fat deposits being the main source of visfatin. In addition to its secreted form, visfatin may also be found intracellularly where it functions as a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt).

We isolated lipid rafts from A549 cells and detected the IR by immunoprecipitation from raft fractions or whole cell lysates.

We used coimmunoprecipitation studies in cells transfected with PBEF and IR beta constructs to detect interactions between PBEF, the IR beta, and caveolin-1 (Cav-1). PBEF was present in both lipid raft and nonraft fractions, whereas the IR was found only in lipid raft fractions of resting A549 cells. The IR-, PBEF-, and Cav-1-coimmunoprecipitated rPBEF treatment resulted in the movement of IR beta- and tyrosine-phosphorylated Cav-1 from lipid rafts to nonrafts, an effect that could be blocked by daporinad, suggesting that this effect was facilitated by the Nampt activity of PBEF. The addition of PBEF to insulin-treated cells resulted in reduced Akt phosphorylation of both Ser(473) and Thr(308).

In all subjects we performed an oral glucose tolerance test, and according to the results the group was divided into the subgroups: A (n = 31), with glucose metabolism disorders (impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes); and B (n = 37), without abnormalities. In all subjects serum lipids, uric acid, C-peptide, glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), creatinine, and serum visfatin concentrations were measured. The control group comprised 30 lean, healthy individuals with normal glucose tolerance. Results: We found elevated visfatin levels in obese individuals versus the control group (50.0 +/- 48 vs. 26.7 +/- 22.1 ng/mL; p = 0.01). Visfatin concentrations in both subgroups, A and B, did not differ (40.86 +/- 27.84 vs. 57.7 +/- 59.79 ng/mL; p = 0.19). In subgroup A visfatin concentration correlated significantly with triglycerides (r = 0.37, p = 0.038), HbA(1c) (r = -0.43, p = 0.02), C-peptide (r = -0.38, p = 0.048), and waist-hip ratio (r = -0.41, p = 0.036). Conclusions: The presence of newly diagnosed glucose metabolism abnormalities in obese subjects had no influence on the visfatin level, probably due to preserved endogenous insulin secretion and relatively short exposure to hyperglycaemia in patients with prediabetes or at early stage of type 2 diabetes.",NA,NA,NA,"Kopczynska, Ewa/P-5017-2015; tasci, ilker/B-7556-2009","Kopczynska, Ewa/0000-0001-7412-9024;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0423-104X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2015,"66","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"108","113",NA,"10.5603/EP.2015.0016",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000353919000002",25931039,1,"1 no 13"

Methods Anthropometric measurements, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, fasting blood samples and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed for 243 obese children. We screened the visfatin gene of 24 obese subjects and then performed genotyping of identified genetic variants in other 219 obese children through direct DNA sequencing. Results Fasting serum visfatin correlated with measures of obesity and liver enzymes and was elevated in obese children with abnormal glucose tolerance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The two upstream single nucleotide polymorphisms, -3187G>A (rs11977021) and -1537C>T (rs61330082), were at complete linkage disequilibrium. The AA genotype of -3187G>A was associated with higher serum visfatin (6.17 +/- 0.76 ng mL(-1) vs. 3.92 +/- 0.44 ng mL(-1)) and higher triglyceride (1.39 +/- 0.08 mmol L-1 vs. 1.19 +/- 0.07 mmol L-1) as compared with the GG genotype.

Adipose tissue is a true endocrine organ that produces and secretes a wide range of mediators regulating adipose tissue function in an auto-/paracrine manner and important distant targets, such as the liver, skeletal muscle, the pancreas and the cardiovascular system. In metabolic disorders such as obesity, enlargement of adipocytes leads to adipose tissue dysfunction and a shift in the secretory profile with an increased release of pro-inflammatory adipokines. Adipose tissue dysfunction has a central role in the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Besides the well-acknowledged role of adipokines in metabolic diseases, and the increasing number of adipokines being discovered in the last years, the mechanisms underlying the release of many adipokines from adipose tissue remain largely unknown. To combat metabolic diseases, it is crucial to better understand how adipokines can modulate adipose tissue growth and function. Therefore, we will focus on adipokines with a prominent role in auto-/paracrine crosstalk within the adipose tissue such as RBP4, HO-1, WISP2, SFRPs and chemerin. To depict the endocrine crosstalk between adipose tissue with skeletal muscle, the cardiovascular system and the pancreas, we will report the main findings regarding the direct effects of adiponectin, leptin, DPP4 and visfatin on skeletal muscle insulin resistance, cardiovascular function and -cell growth and function.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1748-1708","1748-1716",NA,NA,NA,"APR",2014,"210","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"733","753",NA,"10.1111/apha.12246",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000332757600008",24495317,1,"1 no 25"

Expression of visfatin was observed in Leydig cells, spermatocytes and sperm in control as well as in the diabetic group. Mild immunostaining of visfatin was observed in affected seminiferous tubules of alloxan-induced diabetic rat testis. Western blot analysis showed decreased expression of testicular visfatin in diabetic rats. The expression of visfatin showed a positive correlation with serum testosterone levels, body and testis weight, while a negative correlation was observed with blood glucose levels.

Aim: The aim of this study is to summarize data concerning adipokines in lung cancer pathogenesis, prognosis and survival; the role of adipokines in lung cancer cachexia is also examined. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in the electronic database of Medline. Several studies and review articles met the inclusion criteria. Results: Leptin and adiponectin are the best studied adipokines. The majority of the relevant studies has investigated the potential correlations mainly between leptin, adiponectin, and sometimes also resistin, and nutritional status, systemic inflammation of lung cancer or lung cancer cachexia and have also assessed their prognostic significance. Few other studies have studied genetic variations in leptin, leptin receptor and adiponectin genes and their association with lung cancer susceptibility and prognosis. The ongoing list of adipokines associated with lung cancer also includes resistin, chemerin, and visfatin. Conclusions: Increasing evidence points to the involvement of certain adipocytokines in lung cancer development, progression and prognosis.

Methods: 35 severely obese patients (26 females and 9 males), aged 15-58 years, were studied. Anthropometric parameters and biochemical parameters as well as adiponectin and visfatin were analyzed before and 6 weeks after weight reduction. Results: Anthropometric indices decreased significantly. Blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride were reduced significantly. The reduction of visfatin and the elevation of adiponectin were significant as well. However, other parameters like fasting glucose and insulin did not change. Moreover, we could not find any significant correlation between the change of serum visfatin and that of adiponectin. Conclusions : 6-week weight reduction after bariatric surgery resulted in decreased serum visfatin and increased adiponectin levels. However, we cannot find any significant correlation between changes of adiponectin, visfatin, BMI, waist circumference, and insulin resistance.

The aim of this study was to characterize Nampt expression, secretion and regulation by glucose in human islets. Gene and protein expression of Nampt was assessed in human pancreatic tissue and isolated islets by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence/confocal imaging respectively. Variable amounts of Nampt mRNA were detected in pancreatic tissue and isolated islets. Immunofluorescence staining for Nampt was found in the exocrine and endocrine tissue of fetal pancreas. However, in adulthood, Nampt expression was localized predominantly in beta cells. Isolated human islets secreted increasing amounts of eNampt in response to high glucose (20 mM) in a static glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assay (GSIS). In addition to an increase in eNampt secretion, exposure to 20 mM glucose also increased Nampt mRNA levels but not protein content. The secretion of eNampt was attenuated by the addition of membrane depolarization inhibitors, diazoxide and nifedipine. Islet-secreted eNampt showed enzymatic activity in a reaction with increasing production of NAD+/NADH over time.

Potential preventive and therapeutic perspectives and challenges","MEDICAL HYPOTHESES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Worldwide breast cancer (BC) constitutes a significant public health concern. Excess body weight is associated with postmenopausal BC (PBC) risk. Recent studies have shown that the constellation of obesity, insulin resistance and serum adipokine levels are associated with the risk and prognosis of PBC. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl-transferase (Nampt), also known as visfatin and pre-B-cell-colony-enhancing factor. found in the visceral fat, represents a novel pleiotropic adipokine acting as a cytokine, a growth factor and an enzyme. It plays an important role in a variety of metabolic and stress responses as well as in the cellular energy metabolism, particularly NAD biosynthesis. Nampt exhibits proliferative, anti-apoptotic, pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic properties. Nampt's insulin-mimetic function remains a controversial issue. Circulating Nampt levels are increased in obese women. Also, Nampt levels are significantly elevated in women suffering from PBC than in healthy controls independently from known risk factors of BC, anthropometric and metabolic parameters as well as serum concentrations of well known adipokines. High expression of Nampt in BC tissues was reported to be associated with more malignant cancer behavior as well as adverse prognosis. Taking into account the mitogenicity of Nampt as well as its proliferative, anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic properties, a novel hypothesis is proposed whereas Nampt may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of PBC and may represent a missing link between overweight/obesity and PBC. Nampt could exert its effects on the normal and neoplastic mammary tissue by endocrine and paracrine mechanisms; Nampt could also be secreted by tumor epithelial cells in an autocrine manner. It could stimulate mammary epithelial cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis, which is essential for BC development and progression. Serum Nampt might be a novel risk factor as well as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in PBC. In addition, pharmacologic agents that neutralize biochemically Nampt or medications that decrease Nampt levels or downregulate signaling pathways downstream of Nampt may prove to be useful anti-cancer agents. The potential harmful effect on PBC risk due to vitamin 133 (nicotinic acid, a natural NAD precursor in the biosynthetic route leading to NAD) intake is speculated for the first time. In this hypothesis, the role of Nampt in BC carcinogenesis and progression is explored as well as the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the association between Nampt and PBC in the context of a dysfunctional adipose tissue in obesity. Understanding of these mechanisms may be important for the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies against PBC. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides the well-known role of insulin and adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin, in the regulation of energy homeostasis, signals from other tissues not previously thought to play a role in body weight regulation have emerged in recent years. The role of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) produced by the liver in the regulation of body weight and insulin sensitivity has been recently described. Moreover, molecules expressed by skeletal muscle such as myostatin have also been involved in adipose tissue regulation. Better known is the involvement of ghrelin, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and PYY3-36, produced by the gut, in energy homeostasis. Even the kidney, through the production of renin, appears to regulate body weight, with mice lacking this hormone exhibiting resistance to diet-induced obesity. In addition, the skeleton has recently emerged as an endocrine organ, with effects on body weight control and glucose homeostasis through the actions of bone-derived factors such as osteocalcin and osteopontin.

We recently reported the role of visfatin in prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) synthesis in chondrocytes. Here, our aim was to characterize the signaling pathways involved in this response in exploring both the insulin receptor (IR) signaling pathway and Nampt activity. IR was expressed in human and murine chondrocytes, and visfatin triggered Akt phosphorylation in murine chondrocytes. Blocking IR expression with siRNA or activity using the hydroxy-2-naphthalenyl methyl phosphonic acid tris acetoxymethyl ester (HNMPA-(AM)(3)) inhibitor diminished visfatin-induced PGE(2) release in chondrocytes. Moreover, visfatin-induced IGF-1R(-/-) chondrocytes released higher concentration of PGE(2) than IGF-1R (+/+) cells, a finding confirmed with an antibody that blocked IGF-1R. Using RT-PCR, we found that visfatin did not regulate IR expression and that an increased insulin release was also unlikely to be involved because insulin was unable to increase PGE(2) release. Inhibition of Nampt activity using the APO866 inhibitor gradually decreased PGE(2) release, whereas the addition of exogenous nicotinamide increased it.

Circulating visfatin levels have been positively associated with vascular damage and endothelial dysfunction. Here, we investigated the ability of visfatin to directly impair vascular reactivity in mesenteric microvessels from both male Sprague-Dawley rats and patients undergoing non-urgent, non-septic abdominal surgery. The pre-incubation of rat microvessels with visfatin (50 and 100 ng/mL) did not modify the contractile response to noradrenaline (1 pmol/L to 30 mu mol/L), as determined using a small vessel myograph. However, visfatin (10 to 100 ng/mL) concentration-dependently impaired the relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh; 100 pmol/L to 3 mu mol/L), without interfering with the endothelium-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol/L to 3 mu mol/L). In both cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and rat microvascular preparations, visfatin (50 ng/mL) stimulated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, as determined by lucigenin-derived chemiluminiscence. The relaxation to ACh impaired by visfatin was restored by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin (10 mu mol/L). Additionally, the Nampt inhibitor APO866 (10 mmol/L to 10 mu mol/L), but not an insulin receptor-blocking antibody, also prevented the stimulation of NADPH oxidase and the relaxation impairment elicited by visfatin.

Such associations are possibly mediated by adipokines. We investigated the in vitro effects of visfatin (an adipokine) on chemokine expression in human keratinocytes. Normal human keratinocytes were incubated with visfatin, and their chemokine production was analyzed by ELISA and RT-PCR. Visfatin enhanced TNF-alpha-induced CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 8, CXCL10, and CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 20 secretion and mRNA expression in keratinocytes, although visfatin alone was ineffective. A small interfering RNA against nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 suppressed the visfatin-induced production of CXCL8, CXCL10, and CCL20 whereas a small interfering RNA against signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 suppressed CXCL8 induction. This indicates the involvement of NF-kappa B in CXCL8, CXCL10, and CCL20 induction by visfatin and the involvement of STAT3 in CXCL8 induction. Visfatin alone increased the transcriptional activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, which was suppressed by Janus kinase (JAK) 2 inhibitor. Visfatin enhanced basal and TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa B activity and inhibitory kappa B (I kappa B) alpha phosphorylation, which was suppressed by I kappa B kinase inhibitor. Visfatin induced the tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of JAK2 and I kappa B kinase alpha/beta, respectively. Intraperitoneal injection of visfatin elevated mRNA and protein levels of CXCL1, CXCL10, and CCL20 in murine skin. These results suggest that visfatin enhances CXCL8, CXCL10, and CCL20 production in human keratinocytes and homologous chemokine production in murine skin. Visfatin may induce the infiltration of type 1 or type 17 helper T cells or neutrophils to the skin via chemokine induction and thus link metabolic syndromes to psoriasis.

Human and chicken skeletal muscles are reported to have the highest level of Nampt expression among various tissues whose functional significance remains undetermined. Expression of Nampt is regulated by interleukin-6 (IL-6), an essential cytokine for postnatal muscle growth in mammals. The objective of the current study was to characterize expression of Nampt in chicken (Gallus gallus) myogenic cells and to determine the effect of Nampt on expression of IL-6, myogenic transcription factors, and glucose uptake. We also sought to determine the effect of IL-6 on Nampt expression in chicken myogenic cells. Nampt mRNA and protein were identified in both myoblasts and myocytes, although expression did not differ between the two cell types. Treatment with recombinant human Nampt was found to decrease myoD and mrf4 expression but to increase myf5 expression in myocytes, while glucose uptake was unaffected. In response to treatment with recombinant Nampt, IL-6 expression in myocytes was increased at 24 h but decreased when treated for 48 or 72 h. Forced over-expression of chicken Nampt cDNA significantly decreased myf5 expression in myoblasts. Treatment of myogenic cells with lower levels (1 ng.mL(-1)) of recombinant IL-6 increased Nampt expression, whereas a higher IL-6 concentration (100 ng.mL(-1)) decreased Nampt mRNA abundance. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Nampt, regulated in part by IL-6, alters the expression of key myogenic transcription factors and thereby may influence postnatal myogenesis.

To assess the ability of pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF) to regulate inflammation and degradative processes in inflammatory arthritis, using the small molecule inhibitor APO866 in human fibroblasts in vitro and in murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Methods. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to examine regulation of expression of metalloproteinases and chemokines in human fibroblasts. The role of PBEF was further examined using APO866 in mice with CIA, with effects on disease activity assessed using radiography, histology, in vivo imaging, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results. In vitro activation of human fibroblasts with PBEF promoted expression of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), CCL2, and CXCL8, an effect inhibited by APO866. In mice with CIA, early intervention with APO866 inhibited synovial inflammation, including chemokine-directed leukocyte infiltration, and reduced a systemic marker of inflammation, serum hyaluronic acid. APO866 blockade led to reduced expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in joint extracts and to a reduction in a systemic marker of cartilage erosion, serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. Radio logic images revealed that APO866 protected against bone erosion, while qPCR demonstrated inhibition of RANKL expression. In mice with established disease, APO866 reduced synovial inflammation and cartilage destruction, and halted bone erosion. In addition, APO866 reduced the activity of MMP-3, CCL2, and RANKL in vivo, and inhibited production of CCL2 and RANKL in synovial explants from arthritic mice, a result that was reversed with nicotinamide mononucleotide.

Metabolic syndrome is characterized by changes in arterial blood pressure, glucose metabolism, lipid and lipoprotein profiles in addition to inflammation. Adipose tissue produces many cytokines and secretory factors termed adipokines. Intra-abdominal (visceral) adipose tissue in particular, rather than peripheral, appears to be associated with global cardiometabolic risk. The present article summarizes information on five recently discovered adipokines: vaspin, visfatin, apelin, acylation stimulating protein (ASP) and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and their potential beneficial or deleterious roles in obesity and atherosclerosis. Vaspin may have antiatherogenic effects through its potential insulin-sensitizing properties. Similarly, visfatin has been suggested to enhance insulin sensitivity, but its potential role in plaque destabilization may counteract this. Apelin, via inhibition of food intake, and increases in physical activity and body temperature, may promote weight loss, resulting in a beneficial antiatherogenic effect. Further, favourable effects on vasodilatation and blood pressure add to this positive effect. Considering its increased levels in subjects with demonstrated atherosclerosis, RBP4 may constitute a biomarker. Lastly, ASP, often increased in obesity and metabolic disorders, may be contributing to efficient lipid storage, and decreasing or blocking ASP may provide a potential antiobesity target. Adipokines may further contribute to obesity-atherosclerosis relationships, the full understanding of which will require further research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of obesity on circulating concentrations and gene expression levels of NAMPT in human peripheral blood cells (PBCs) as well as its involvement in inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism. Methods and results: Forty-four serum samples obtained from 14 lean and 30 obese volunteers were used to analyse the circulating concentrations of NAMPT. In addition, PBC, omental adipose tissue (OM) and liver biopsy samples obtained from a subgroup of subjects were used to determine transcript levels of NAMPT by Real-time PCR. Glucose and lipid profile as well as several inflammatory factors and hepatic enzymes were analysed. NAMPT circulating concentrations (P < 0.01) and gene expression levels in PBC (P < 0.05) were significantly increased in obese patients as compared to lean subjects. Total-cholesterol (P = 0.016), HDL-cholesterol (P = 0.036) and triglycerides (P = 0.050) were significant and independent determinants of circulating concentrations of NAMPT (P < 0.01). Moreover, a positive correlation (P < 0.01) was found with the hepatic enzymes alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase after BMI adjustment. Conclusion: Our work shows that NAMPT circulating concentrations and mRNA expression levels in PBC are increased in obese patients and that plasma NAMPT levels are related to inflammation, lipid metabolism and hepatic enzymes suggesting a potential involvement in fatty liver disease and in the obesity-associated inflammatory state.

It relies upon the activation of the so-called Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase (RISK) pathway. Experimentally various treatments, both mechanical and chemical, have been shown to protect the myocardium against I/R injury. Chemical facilitators of myocardial preservation include endogenous factors such as insulin, erythropoietin and glucagon-like peptide 1. The adipocytokines, products of white adipose tissue, are important peptide hormones with respect to metabolic control and satiety, and were formerly considered in the context of obesity and metabolic disease. More recently, however, evidence has been presented indicating that the adipocytokines play significant roles in cardiac function and, as we have suggested, in myocardial protection. To date leptin, adiponectin, apelin and visfatin have all been shown to protect against I/R injury. Significantly, the protection afforded by these peptides involves the activation of kinases which are key elements of the mechanisms underlying tissue preservation, including the RISK pathway components PI3K-Akt and p44/42, and inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). In this article we examine the roles played by the adipocytokines in cardiovascular function and disease. In particular, we focus on the evidence that these peptides promote myocardial survival, much of it having been obtained in this laboratory. To conclude, we discuss some future directions in the field, including the prospects for some of the adipocytokines finding application as therapeutic agents in myocardial infarction.

The present study was designed to test a hypothesis that visfatin causes coronary endothelial dysfunction through lysosome trafficking and fusion to cell membranes, membrane raft (MR) clustering, and formation of redox signalosomes. Methods and results By using confocal microscopy, it was found that visfatin, but not adiponectin, stimulated NADPH oxidase (NOX) subunits, gp91(phox) aggregation in MR clusters and p47(phox) translocation to these MR clusters in bovine coronary arterial endothelial cells (CAECs), leading to activation of NOX with a 2.5-fold increase in O(2)(-) production. A signalling lipid, ceramide, was found to be enriched in such membrane MR-NOX complexes of CAECs. Lysosomal fluorescent dye (FM1-43) quenching and de-quenching revealed that visfatin induced the fusion of lysosomes to cell membranes and incorporation of acid sphingomyelinase and its product, ceramide, in such MR-NOX signalling platforms. Functionally, visfatin significantly attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodilation in small coronary arteries (by 80%), which was blocked by lysosomal function inhibitor and MR disruptors.

Mammalian SIRT1 - a homolog of yeast Sir2, the prototypical member of the sirtuin family - is an important regulator of metabolism, cell differentiation and senescence, stress response, and cancer. As an NAD(+)-dependent enzyme, SIRT1 regulates gene expression programs in response to cellular metabolic status, thereby coordinating metabolic adaptation of the whole organism. Several important mechanisms have emerged for SIRT1-dependent regulation of transcription. First. SIRT1 can modulate chromatin function through direct deacetylation of histones as well as by promoting alterations in the methylation of histones and DNA, leading to the repression of transcription. The latter is accomplished through the recruitment of other nuclear enzymes to chromatin for histone methylation and DNA CpG methylation, suggesting a broader role of SIRT1 in epigenetic regulation. Second, SIRT1 can interact and deacetylate a broad range of transcription factors and coregulators, thereby regulating target gene expression both positively and negatively. Cellular energy state, specifically NAD(+) metabolism, plays a major role in the regulation of SIRT1 activity. Recent studies on the NAD(+) biosynthetic enzymes in the salvage pathway, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT-1), have revealed important functions for these enzymes in SIRT1-dependent transcription regulation.

Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) exhibit increased serum concentrations of PBEF/Nampt/visfatin and weight loss is associated both with a decrease in serum levels and reduced liver expression. Many of the biological functions of this ""cytokine-enzyme"" have been characterized in the last years, however, its definite role in various metabolic, inflammatory and malignant diseases has yet to be defined.

First published November 3, 2009; doi: 10.1152/ajpendo.00318.2009.-In mammals, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is responsible for the first and rate-limiting step in the conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). NAD(+) is an obligate cosubstrate for mammalian sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a deacetylase that activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1 alpha), which in turn can activate mitochondrial biogenesis. Given that mitochondrial biogenesis is activated by exercise, we hypothesized that exercise would increase NAMPT expression, as a potential mechanism leading to increased mitochondrial content in muscle. A cross-sectional analysis of human subjects showed that athletes had about a twofold higher skeletal muscle NAMPT protein expression compared with sedentary obese, nonobese, and type 2 diabetic subjects (P < 0.05). NAMPT protein correlated with mitochondrial content as estimated by complex III protein content (R(2) = 0.28, P < 0.01), MRS-measured maximal ATP synthesis (R(2) = 0.37, P = 0.002), and (V) over dotO(2max) (R(2) = 0.63, P < 0.0001). In an exercise intervention study, NAMPT protein increased by 127% in sedentary nonobese subjects after 3 wk of exercise training (P < 0.01). Treatment of primary human myotubes with forskolin, a cAMP signaling pathway activator, resulted in an similar to 2.5-fold increase in NAMPT protein expression, whereas treatment with ionomycin had no effect. Activation of AMPK via AICAR resulted in an similar to 3.4-fold increase in NAMPT mRNA (P < 0.05) as well as modest increases in NAMPT protein (P < 0.05) and mitochondrial content (P < 0.05).

We investigated the effects of repeated short bouts of high-intensity exercise on plasma visfatin and related metabolic responses. Methods: Six young, physically fit men (22.8 +/- 2.3 years; 78.5 +/- 2.3 kg; and body mass index 22.1 +/- 1.2) performed a single session of a running-based anaerobic sprint exercise (7 sets of 6 x 35 m every 10 s, with 1 min rest between sets). Venous blood samples were collected before, immediately after, and 45 and 90 min after exercise to assess plasma visfatin, insulin, glucose, lactate and glutathione responses. Results: After adjustment for postexercise changes in plasma volume, the data indicate a significant increase in plasma visfatin (12.5 +/- 2.0 vs. 26.6 +/- 3.9 ng/ml, p < 0.02), insulin (p < 0.05), and glucose (p < 0.002) concentrations, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (p < 0.02), immediately after the exercise session. At 45 min of recovery, all metabolic measures, with the exception of lactate, had returned to baseline levels. Conclusion: The elevation in plasma visfatin, together with increased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations immediately after high-intensity exercise, may sensitize tissues for postexercise glucose uptake and glycogen restoration.

The study aimed to examine whether visfatin/PBEF/Nampt was predominantly expressed in VAT and was correlated with obesity. The relationship of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt gene expression in adipose tissues with proinfiammatory gene expression and metabolic phenotypes was also examined. The relative messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt, macrophage-specific marker CD68, and prointlammatory genes were measured in paired abdominal VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissues (SAT) and from 53 nondiabetic adults using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

There was no difference in visfatin/PBEF/Nampt mRNA levels between VAT and SAT, and neither was associated with measures of obesity. Visfatin/PBEF/Nampt mRNA levels were strongly correlated with proinflammatory gene expression including CD68 and tumor necrosis factor a gene in both VAT and SAT.

Since the putative insulin mimicking effects of visfatin/Nampt/PEBF1 have never been tested on mature human adipocytes, at least to our knowledge, we tested different human visfatin batches on human fat cells freshly isolated from subcutaneous abdominal fat and exhibiting high insulin responsiveness. Up to 10 nM, visfatin was devoid of clear activatory action on glucose transport in human fat cells while, in the same conditions, insulin increased by more than threefold the basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Moreover, visfatin was unable to mimic the lipolysis inhibition induced by insulin. Visfatin definitively cannot be considered as a direct activator of insulin signalling in human fat cells.

No changes were observed in the expression and serum levels of visfatin and apelin, or in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma and Sirtl expression. Energy restriction reduced body fat and normalized insulin sensitivity. Visfatin showed increased serum levels without changes in expression. No modifications were found as far as apelin was concerned. Sirtl expression was increased. and PPAR gamma remained unchanged. With regard to trans-10,cis-12 CLA, no changes were induced by its addition to the restricted diet. Conclusions: Insulin function impairment induced by HFHS feeding is not mediated by visfatin and apelin. However, visfatin can play a role in improving insulin sensitivity associated with energy restriction. These results suggest that visfatin may not have evolved as a molecule that reserves the action of insulin when food is widely available, but rather that its function seems to be associated with energy restriction adaptation.

Here, we explored the ability of ePBEF/NAMPT/visfatin to promote vascular inflammation, as a condition closely related to atherothrombotic diseases. We specifically studied the ability of PBEF/NAMPT/visfatin to directly activate pathways leading to inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction in cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells, as well as the mechanisms involved. Methods iNOS levels and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activity were determined by western blotting. Nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activity was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Results ePBEF/NAMPT/visfatin (10-250 ng/ml) induced iNOS in a concentration-dependent manner. At a submaximal concentration (100 ng/ml), ePBEF/NAMPT/visfatin time-dependently enhanced iNOS levels up to 18 h after stimulation. Over this time period, ePBEF/NAMPT/visfatin elicited a sustained activation of NF-kappa B and triggered a biphasic ERK 1/2 activation. By using the respective ERK 1/2 and NF-kappa B inhibitors, PD98059 and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, we established that iNOS induction by ePBEF/NAMPT/visfatin required the consecutive upstream activation of ERK 1/2 and NF-kappa B. The pro-inflammatory action of ePBEF/NAMPT/visfatin was not prevented by insulin receptor blockade. However, exogenous nicotinamide mononucleotide, the product of NAMPT activity, mimicked NF-kappa B activation and iNOS induction by ePBEF/NAMPT/visfatin, while the NAMPT inhibitor APO866 prevented the effects of ePBEF/NAMPT/visfatin on iNOS and NF-kappa B.

Cancer cells have a very high rate of NAD(+) turnover, which makes NAD(+) modulation an attractive target for anticancer therapy. Selective inhibition by GMX1778 of NAMPT blocks the production of NAD(+) and results in tumor cell death. Furthermore, GMX1778 is phosphoribosylated by NAMPT, which increases its cellular retention. The cytotoxicity of GMX1778 can be bypassed with exogenous nicotinic acid (NA), which permits NAD(+) repletion via NA phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (NAPRT1). The cytotoxicity of GMX1778 in cells with NAPRT1 deficiency, however, cannot be rescued by NA. Analyses of NAPRT1 mRNA and protein levels in cell lines and primary tumor tissue indicate that high frequencies of glioblastomas, neuroblastomas, and sarcomas are deficient in NAPRT1 and not susceptible to rescue with NA. As a result, the therapeutic index of GMX1777 can be widended in the treatment animals bearing NAPRT1-deficient tumors by coadministration with NA.

Purpose: We hypothesized that if visfatin does play a role in the insulin response, then the exercise training-induced reduction in insulin response to an oral glucose load would correlate with reduced plasma visfatin. Methods: Sixteen obese men and women (age = 65 +/- 1 yr, body mass index = 33.4 +/- 1.5 kg.m(-2)) volunteered to participate in a 12-wk supervised exercise program (5 d.wk(-1), 60 min.d(-1) at 85% of HR(max)). Visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were measured by computed tomographic scans. A 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed to determine the effect of exercise training on the insulin response to a glucose load. Fasting plasma visfatin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Exercise training resulted in an increase in (V) over dotO(2max) (21.1 +/- 0.9 vs 24.2 +/- 1.1 mL.kg(-1).min(-1), P < 0.001), a decrease in body weight (96.4 +/- 4.1 vs 92.4 +/- 3.7 kg, P < 0.001), VAT (191 +/- 16 vs 144 +/- 16 cm(2), P < 0.001), and SAT (369 +/- 34 vs 309 +/- 41 cm(2), P < 0.02).

The first step of the nicotinamide-dependent NAD-rescue pathway is operated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NaPRT) forming nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Because of the difficulties in measuring NMN, numerous open questions exist about the pathophysiological relevance of NaPRT and NMN itself Here, we describe a new method of fluorimetric NMN detection upon derivatization of its alkylpyridinium group with acetophenone. By adopting this method, we analyzed the kinetics of nicotinamide-dependent NAD recycling in HeLa and U937 cells. Measurement of NMN contents in subcellular fractions revealed that the nucleotide is highly enriched in mitochondria, suggesting intramitochondrial NAD synthesis. NMN increases in cells undergoing hyperactivation of the NAD-consuming enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1, or exposed to gallotannin, a putative inhibitor of NMN-adenylyl transferases. Evidence that the inhibitor of NAD resynthesis FK866 selectively inhibits NaPRT having no effect on NMNAT activity is also provided. Importantly, NMN reduces NAD and ATP depletion in cells undergoing PARP-1 hyperactivation, significantly delaying cell death.

Key reactions for NAD(P) biosynthesis in all organisms, common to both de novo and salvage routes, are catalyzed by NMN/NaMN adenylyltransferase (NMNAT), NAD synthetase (NADS), and NAD kinase (NADK). These reactions represent a three-step pathway, present in the vast majority of living organisms, which is responsible for the generation of both NAD and NADP cellular pools. The validation of these enzymes as drug targets is based on their essentiality and conservation among a large variety of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as on their differential structural features or their differential metabolic contribution to NAD(P) homeostasis between microbial and human cell types.

We examined in humans whether visfatin is found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, if so, how CSF,visfatin concentrations relate to adiposity and metabolic parameters. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We measured visfatin concentrations in the plasma and CSF of 38 subjects (18 men and 20 women; age 19-80 years) with a wide range of body weight (BMI 16.24-38.10 kg/m(2)). In addition, anthropometric parameters and endocrine markets were assessed. Bivariate correlation coefficients were determined and stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed to detect associations of CSF and plasma visfatin levels with relevant parameters. RESULTS-Plasma visfatin levels increased with rising BMI (P < 0.0001) and body fat mass (P < 0.0001). In contrast, CSF visfatin levels decreased with increasing plasma visfatin concentrations (P < 0.03), BMI (P < 0.001), body fat mass (P < 0.0001), and insulin resistance (P < 0.05). Body fat was the only factor independently associated with CSF visfatin, explaining 58% of the variation of CSF visfatin levels (P < 0.0001). Neither plasma (P > 0.13) nor CSF (P > 0.61) visfatin concentrations differed between men and women. CONCLUSIONS-Our data indicate that visfatin concentrations in human CSF decrease with rising body fat, supporting the assumption that visfatin transport across the blood-brain barrier is impaired in obesity and that central nervous visfatin insufficiency or resistance are linked to pathogenetic mechanisms of obesity.

Herein we tested the hypothesis that eNampt could promote cell survival in macrophages subjected to endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress, a process associated with obesity and obesity-associated diseases. We show that eNampt potently blocks macrophage apoptosis induced by a number of ER stressors. The mechanism involves a two-step sequential process: rapid induction of interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion, followed by IL-6-mediated autocrine/paracrine activation of the prosurvival signal transducer STAT3.

Thus, eNampt protects macrophages from ER stress-induced apoptosis by activating an IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway via a nonenzymatic mechanism.

The mechanisms whereby antipsychotics induce weight gain are not known. It has been suggested that peptides related to food intake and energy balance could play a role in weight gain secondary to antipsychotic therapy. To better understand the pathophysiology of antipsychotic-induced weight gain, we studied the effects of 3 antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone) on peptides involved in energy balance (insulin, ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, and resistin) in a population of drug-naive patients with first episode of psychosis. A significant increase in weight (10.16 kg [SD, 8.30 kg]; P < 0.001), body mass index (3.56 kg/m(2) [SD, 2.89 kg/m(2)]; p < 0.001), And fasting insulin (3.93 mu U/mL [SD, 3.93 mu U/mL]; P = 0.028), leptin (6.76 ng/mL [SD, 7.21 ng/mL]; P < 0.001), and ghrelin (15.47 fmol/mL [SD, 47.90 fmol/mL]; P = 0.009) plasma levels were observed. The increments in insulin and leptin concentrations were highly correlated with the increment in weight and body mass index and seem to be a consequence of the higher fat stores.

However, its role in disease progression remains unknown. We report here that NAMPT is a key player in inflammatory arthritis. Increased expression of NAMPT was confirmed in mice with collagen-induced arthritis, both in serum and in the arthritic paw. Importantly, a specific competitive inhibitor of NAMPT effectively reduced arthritis severity with comparable activity to etanercept, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine secretion in affected joints. Moreover, NAMPT inhibition reduced intracellular NAD concentration in inflammatory cells and circulating TNF alpha levels during endotoxemia in mice.

Within the cell, PBEF functions as a nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase, the rate-limiting step in a salvage pathway of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis. By virtue of this role, it can regulate cellular levels of NAD and so impact not only cellular energetics but also NAD-dependent enzymes such as sirtuins. Although it lacks a signal peptide, PBEF is released by a variety of cells, and elevated levels can be found in the systemic circulation of patients with a variety of inflammatory diseases. As an extracellular cytokine, PBEF can induce the cellular expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6. Finally, PBEF has been shown to be an adipokine expressed by fat cells that exerts a number of insulin mimetic and antagonistic effects.

The disease is vaccine preventable and eradication of the virus is considered feasible, in principle. However, a herd immunity exceeding 95% is required to prevent sporadic viral outbreaks in a population. Declining disease prevalence, combined with public anxiety over the vaccination's safety, has led to increased vaccine refusal, especially in Europe. This has led to the resurgence of measles in some areas. Areas covered: This article discusses whether synergizing effective measles therapeutics with the measles vaccination could contribute to finally eradicating measles. The authors identify key elements in a desirable drug profile and review current disease management strategies and the state of experimental inhibitor candidates. The authors also evaluate the risk associated with viral escape from inhibition, and consider the potential of measles therapeutics in the management of persistent central nervous system (CNS) viral infection. Finally, the authors contemplate the possible impact of therapeutics in controlling the threat imposed by closely related zoonotic pathogens of the same genus as measles. Expert opinion: Efficacious therapeutics used for post-exposure prophylaxis of high-risk social contacts of confirmed index cases may aid measles eradication by closing herd immunity gaps; this is due to vaccine refusal or failure in populations with overall good vaccination coverage.

Second, systematic biases, arising from both the nature of the data and the preconceptions of investigators, are serious threats to the validity of research results, especially in answering causal questions. Third, data mining of biomedical databases makes it easier for individuals with political, social, or economic agendas to generate ostensibly scientific but misleading research findings for the purpose of manipulating public opinion and swaying policymakers. In short, this paper sheds much-needed light on the problems of credulous and uninformed acceptance of research results derived from biomedical databases. An understanding of the pitfalls of big data analysis is of critical importance to anyone who will rely on or dispute its outcomes, including lawyers, policymakers, and the public at large.

Overall, 227 members of the public and 60 police officers completed an online questionnaire involving an investigation into a child sex offence. Participants were asked to first (i) formulate their own profile of a likely offender then (ii) estimate the guilt of two presented suspect descriptions (orthodox vs. unorthodox), and, following the presentation of an expert's profile that matched either the orthodox or the unorthodox suspect, (iii) re-evaluate their guilt judgments of the two suspects based on this new advice. Finally, (iv) the perceived similarity (congruence) between the participants' own and the expert profile was assessed. Results revealed two key findings. First, expert profiles that matched a suspect's description elevated perceptions of guilt in that suspect, whilst also, simultaneously, very significantly decreasing the perception of guilt of the alternative suspect. This suggests a powerful rejection and downward revision of the other suspect. Second, perceived similarity of the profile (to one's own profile) was only a significant factor in increasing guilt judgments when assigning guilt to the unorthodox (as opposed to orthodox) suspect. Comparisons of lay judgments with those of police officers revealed few significant differences in effects. The finding that advice is most influential when unorthodox and incongruent suggests that decision makers are more likely to reevaluate judgments when expert advice contributes novel information that contradicts their beliefs. The practical implications of these findings are discussed for profilers, police, and decision research in general.

Anecdotal evidence, the media, and South African-based anti-vaccination websites and blogs point to the existence of anti-vaccination lobbies in South Africa, although the part played by these lobbies in sub-optimal vaccination coverage is unknown at present. This article discusses some of the claims made by South African anti-vaccination groups, including some drawn from anti-vaccination lobbyists based in highly resourced countries. While research is underway to better understand the scope and influence of anti-vaccine groups, it is important to build capacity among healthcare workers within the Expanded Programme on Immunisation of South Africa to enable them to deal empathically and effectively with parents and caregivers who have been exposed to anti-vaccination messages and who question the need to vaccinate their children. Claims that vaccines cause adverse effects need to be supported by valid and reliable scientific evidence. However, evidence alone that vaccines are safe and effective does not always result in parents being convinced to vaccinate their children. In addition to providing important evidence of vaccine safety, this paper discusses the important role of communication - especially dialogue - in building public trust in vaccination with the ultimate goal of increasing vaccination coverage and preventing future outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.

Study Design and Setting: The SeBriNA is informed by systematic review and bibliometric analysis methodologies. It focuses on two key concepts: I) quality of evidence for patient-centered outcomes using cumulative meta-analysis and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) appraisal approach; 2) quantity of original research and its citation relationships to related documents. It includes four steps: I) research questions and document selection; 2) data extraction and analysis; 3) document network relationships; and 4) document network visualization. Results: The primary output from the SeBriNA is an analysis of 1) evidence-the annual cumulative meta-analysis estimate of effect juxtaposed against quality of evidence by patient-centered outcomes (GRADE), and 2) context-the network of relationships between related documents and original research. This analysis can be represented as a single figure. Conclusions: The SeBriNA may help decision makers conceptualize, interpret, and visualize the quantity, quality, and relevance of original research within a network of related documents. Applications include prospective support for clinical and policy decisions and identification of research gaps. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects associated with the MMR vaccine in children up to 15 years of age. Search methods For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Embase.com (July 2004 to May 2011). Selection criteria We used comparative prospective or retrospective trials assessing the effects of the MMR vaccine compared to placebo, do nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. One review author arbitrated in case of disagreement. Main results We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case-control studies, five time-series trials, one case cross-over trial, two ecological studies, six self controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts. Effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated to be between 69% and 81% for the vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70% and 75% for the vaccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination with MMR containing the Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73% effective in preventing secondary mumps cases. Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory-confirmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one dose and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses. We did not identify any studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR in preventing rubella. The highest risk of association with aseptic meningitis was observed within the third week after immunisation with Urabe-containing MMR (risk ratio (RR) 14.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 7.93 to 25.71) and within the third (RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) or fifth (RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 to 24.2) weeks after immunisation with the vaccine prepared with the Leningrad-Zagreb strain. A significant risk of association with febrile seizures and MMR exposure during the two previous weeks (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15) was assessed in one large person-time cohort study involving 537,171 children aged between three months and five year of age. Increased risk of febrile seizure has also been observed in children aged between 12 to 23 months (relative incidence (RI) 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33) and children aged 12 to 35 months (RI 5.68; 95% CI 2.31 to 13.97) within six to 11 days after exposure to MMR vaccine. An increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR immunisation in children aged 12 to 23 months was assessed in one case-control study (RR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) and in one small self controlled case series (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 5.38; 95% CI 2.72 to 10.62). Increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR exposure was also assessed in one other case-control study involving 2311 children and adolescents between one month and 18 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was unlikely to be associated with autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections. Authors' conclusions The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate.

The article has two empirical parts. The first shows how the vaccine market, which for many years has had immense financial problems, nowadays seems to becoming economically vitalized, mostly due to the production of new and profitable vaccines. However prosperous the future may appear, certain reactions from the public regarding vaccination initiatives offer insight into inherent problems of vaccine policies in many Western countries. In the second part of the article, these problems are exemplified with the recent controversy over the MMR, (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. We conclude that in spite of the improving profit-margins, the vaccine market remains vulnerable and insecure.

Public decision making related to vaccine acceptance is neither driven by scientific nor economic evidence alone, but is also driven by a mix of psychological, sociocultural, and political factors, all of which need to be understood and taken into account by policy and other decision makers. Public trust in vaccines is highly variable and building trust depends on understanding perceptions of vaccines and vaccine risks, historical experiences, religious or political affiliations, and socioeconomic status. Although provision of accurate, scientifically based evidence on the risk benefit ratios of vaccines is crucial, it is not enough to redress the gap between current levels of public confidence in vaccines and levels of trust needed to ensure adequate and sustained vaccine coverage.

In this article, we review the models and systems that have been developed to monitor and respond to concerns regarding vaccine safety and we give illustrative examples of real or perceived vaccine safety issues. The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) was set up 10 years ago and charged to provide the WHO with independent advice on vaccine safety issues. The role of the GACVS is both to analyze and to interpret reports of the adverse effects of vaccines that impact on global vaccination programs and strategies, and to foster the development of improved surveillance systems to detect any adverse effects of vaccines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It also monitors the development of new vaccines during clinical testing and advises on the safe use of vaccines in immunization programs. As success is achieved with reducing the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, there will be increasing attention focused on potential adverse effects, on the development of effective surveillance systems to detect adverse effects, and on improved methods to manage and control any harmful consequences of vaccination.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1476-0584",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2009,"8","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"705","716",NA,"10.1586/ERV.09.40",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000266957500013",NA,2,"2 no 49"

The consensus expert opinion of the panel was that individuals with ASDs deserve the same thoroughness and standard of care in the diagnostic workup and treatment of gastrointestinal concerns as should occur for patients without ASDs. Care providers should be aware that problem behavior in patients with ASDs may be the primary or sole symptom of the underlying medical condition, including some gastrointestinal disorders.

Because of the increasing number and timing of vaccines, they are easy scapegoats for adverse events which occur coincident with vaccine administration, particularly those outcomes that are incompletely understood. In addition, vaccine-preventable disease activity has been greatly reduced by immunizations, causing parents to fear what they perceive might be complications of vaccines more than the actual diseases that the vaccines prevent. It may require years to collect the data necessary to meet the rigorous standards that permit scientists to emphatically reject a vaccine safety concern. During the time needed to collect the evidence, however, those claims can evolve into misinformation. Misinformers may be unintentional (they are uninformed) or intentional, in which case many have profit incentives. The most effective misinformers, however, are parents who truly believe that their child has been injured by vaccines. Misinformation about vaccines can-and is-aggressively disseminated. Presented as fact by prominent individuals, it is often featured in publications, expounded on by the news media, discussed on popular TV and radio talk shows, and made the subject of TV dramas and docudramas. Because these compelling stories often feature prominent people, it is little wonder that other parents become confused. Unfortunately, there are barriers in responding to misinformation including innumeracy on the part of the public and poor communication skills on the part of vaccine spokespersons. Confused parents may delay or refuse immunizations for their child. Many parents have many misperceptions about disease risks and vaccine safety, both those parents who permit their child to be immunized and those who do not. Health professionals can also become confused and some have helped perpetuate misinformation about vaccine safety. The consequences of misinformation about vaccine safety can be declines in immunization acceptance and coverage followed by disease outbreaks with global consequences.

The study population included 257 general practices in Cumbria and Lancashire in 2005. Practice level MMR coverage data for 2002-04 were obtained from the child health information systems of eight Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and linked to information on practice structure, census indicators for deprivation and ethnicity data at lower level super output area and information from a questionnaire survey of practice nurses. Results Mean MMR uptake was 86.4% with a range from 59 to 98%. Twenty-eight per cent (74/257) practices achieved the Department of Health higher target payment level of 90%. The uptake was not associated with practice size, the number of general practitioners (GPs) or practice nurses. There was no correlation between uptake and deprivation or the percentage of non-white population. There was a strong negative association between MMR uptake and barriers to housing and services (r = -0.230, P < 0.001).

The purpose of this work was to assess the association between media coverage of the MMR-autism controversy and MMR immunization in the United States. METHODS. The public-use files of the National Immunization Survey were used to estimate annual MMR coverage from 1995 to 2004. The primary outcome was selective measles-mumps-rubella nonreceipt, that is, those children who received all childhood immunizations except MMR. Media coverage was measured by using LexisNexis, a comprehensive database of national and local news media. Factors associated with MMR nonreceipt were identified by using a logistic regression model. RESULTS. Selective MMR nonreceipt, occurring in as few as 0.77% of children in the 1995 cohort, rose to 2.1% in the 2000 National Immunization Survey. Children included in the 2000 National Immunization Survey were born when the putative link between MMR and autism surfaced in the medical literature but before any significant media attention occurred. Selective nonreceipt was more prevalent in private practices and unrelated to family characteristics. MMR nonreceipt returned to baseline before sustained media coverage of the MMR-autism story began. CONCLUSIONS. There was a significant increase in selective MMR nonreceipt that was temporally associated with the publication of the original scientific literature, suggesting a link between MMR and autism, which preceded media coverage of the MMR-autism controversy.

To determine their influence, we conducted four focus groups in Toronto, Canada examining parental decision-making concerning pediatric vaccination. Our focus groups consisted of both fathers and mothers and parents who fully vaccinated and those who did not. Using the Advocacy Coalition Framework as an analytic guide, we identified several themes that provided insights into how effective the two coalitions have been in conveying their viewpoints. In general, we identified a variety of levels of belief systems existing amongst parents concerned about vaccination, some more amenable to change than others. We found that the choice to not vaccinate was largely a result of concerns about safety and, to a lesser extent, about lack of effectiveness. These parental views reflected the ability of the coalition concerned about vaccination to challenge parents' trust in traditional public health sources of information. In contrast, the parental decision to vaccinate was due to recognizing the importance of preventing disease and also a consequence of not questioning recommendations from public health and physicians and feeling pressured to because of school policies. Importantly, parents who fully vaccinate appear to have weaker belief systems that are potentially susceptible to change.

Abdominal migraine therefore stands as a falsifiable hypothesis with added importance accrued to potential therapeutic interventions.

The purpose of this study was to utilize newly available data from the Saskatchewan immunization Management System (SIMS) to examine city and neighbourhood uptake of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine and identify potential factors that contribute to low immunization uptake in Saskatoon. Methods: The study examined records for 10,287 two year olds between 1999 and 2002 using an ecological study design. The first step consisted of simple rate calculations to determine the total, complete, up-to-date and not up-to-date immunization rates for the city of Saskatoon and in each residential neighbourhood. Quantitative neighbourhood-level data were then used to determine if neighbourhood variables could significantly contribute to the variation in immunization coverage. Results: The findings revealed MMR/MR immunization rates were relatively stable between 1999 and 2002. However, significant disparities were found at the neighbourhood level, with areas of social and economic disadvantage having lower rates of total, complete, and up-to-date immunization uptake compared to areas of greater social and economic wealth. Multivariate linear regression revealed 80.6% of variation in up-to-date immunization uptake in Saskatoon could be explained by the proportion of single mothers and vehicles per capita in the neighbourhood. Conclusion: Significant inequities in immunization uptake exist on the neighbourhood level in Saskatoon.

The proportion of 'hard-core rejectors' of MMR vaccine remains stable at 6%. There has been a gradual and sustained increase in the proportion of parents across all social groups saying MMR was completely safe/slight risk rising from 60% in 2002 to a current level of 74%.

This review focuses on the risk of seizures following vaccination and the alleged associations of vaccination with vaccine encephalopathy and also with autism spectrum disorders. Recent findings Over the last decade the introduction of new vaccines such as the acellular pertussis vaccine has produced a reduction in seizures following vaccination, the outcome of which was benign even with older vaccines. New evidence emerged in 2006 showing that cases of alleged 'vaccine encephalopathy' are due to mutations within a sodium channel gene.

One of the reasons suggested for this decline is a loss of public trust in politicians and health professionals. The purpose of this analysis was to examine parents' views on the role the media, politicians and health professionals have played in providing credible evidence about MMR safety. Methods: A qualitative focus group study conducted with parents living in Central Scotland. Eighteen focus groups were conducted with 72 parents ( 64 mothers and 8 fathers) between November 2002 and March 2003. Purposive sampling was used to ensure maximum variation among parents. Results: In the period after the MMR controversy, parents found it difficult to know who to trust to offer balanced and accurate information. The general consensus was that politicians were untrustworthy in matters of health. The motives of primary health care providers were suspected by some parents, who saw them as having a range of vested interests ( including financial incentives). Among the sources of evidence seen by some parents as more credible were other parents, and Andrew Wakefield who was viewed as an important whistle-blower and champion of ordinary parents.

Methods: We used Sandman's model of components predicting community outrage to assess the MMR controversy. Results: The controversy fulfilled all of Sandman's 12 primary components and six of the eight additional components. Conclusions: The Sandman model provided a useful framework to analyse this controversy and explained a significant portion of the community reaction and subsequent fall in vaccination coverage rates.

Many parents of vaccination-age children are unaware of the procedures in place for postmarketing surveillance of vaccines. Thus, we propose specific steps for generating such awareness, such as assisting parents to report suspected adverse reactions directly to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) via the Yellow Card scheme, providing information about adverse reaction reporting with vaccination information packs, and displaying posters and leaflets to convey the message that patient concerns and experiences are taken seriously by the MHRA and to generate further awareness about the scheme.

The most instantly recognizable member is measles virus (MV) and individuals acutely infected with the virus exhibit a wide range of clinical symptoms ranging from a characteristic mild self-limiting infection to death. Canine distemper virus (CDV) and rinderpest virus (RPV) cause a similar but distinctive pathology in dogs and cattle, respectively, and these, alongside experimental MV infection of primates, have been useful models for MV pathogenesis. Traditionally, viruses were identified because a distinctive disease was observed in man or animals; an infectious agent was subsequently isolated, cultured, and this could be used to recapitulate the disease in an experimentally infected host. Thus, satisfying Koch's postulates has been the norm. More recently, particularly due to the advent of exceedingly sensitive molecular biological assays, many researchers have looked for infectious agents in disease conditions for which a viral aetiology has not been previously established. For these cases, the modified Koch's postulates of Bradford Hill have been developed as criteria to link a virus to a specific disease. Only in a few cases have these conditions been fulfilled. Therefore, many viruses have over the years been definitely and tentatively linked to human diseases and in this respect the morbilliviruses are no different. In this review, human diseases associated with morbillivirus infection have been grouped into three broad categories: (1) those which are definitely caused by the infection; (2) those which may be exacerbated or facilitated by an infection; and (3) those which currently have limited, weak, unsubstantiated or no credible scientific evidence to support any link to a morbillivirus. Thus, an attempt has been made to clarify the published data and separate human diseases actually linked to morbilliviruses from those that are merely anecdotally associated.

Increasing uptake rates for MMR vaccination requires an understanding of factors leading parents to decide for and against vaccination, particularly in the light of recent developments. Objective. We investigated factors relevant to immunising and non-immunising parents and the extent to which these factors predicted their decisions. Methods. The study was conducted in Edinburgh, UK. A two-stage mixed method design was used. Delphi technique elicited parents' views of factors relevant to MMR immunisation. Twenty-six factors identified as relevant were incorporated into a final questionnaire. Using cluster sampling, the final questionnaire was distributed to parents recruited through a group of local nurseries. 110 parents participated: eighty (72.7%) had had their child MMR vaccinated, thirty (27.3%) had refused the vaccine. The factors in the final questionnaire were analysed against vaccination status using a direct binary logistic regression model. Results. Four factors significantly predicted vaccination status, (prediction toward 'yes vaccination'). These were the influence of current research (OR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.07-0.51), the helpfulness of leaflets and information packs (OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.38-7.75), the importance of eradication of rubella (OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.01-5.78), and the importance attached to the risk of adverse reactions (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.48-0.87). Conclusions. Differences between immunising and non-immunising parents lie in the importance attached to four relevant factors.

This has been achieved with a high uptake of two doses of measles-containing vaccine. Even in industrialized countries, where vaccine uptake is poor , for example Japan, the disease is still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Vaccine failure is predominantly due to primary vaccine failure, which may, in part, be genetic in origin and related to HLA type. Measles containing vaccines have been shown to be associated with febrile convulsions, but there is no strong evidence of a link with atopy. There is considerable evidence that there is no causal relationship with autistic disorders. In spite of this, many parents and some professionals have concerns about the safety of the vaccine, which may lead to their underuse.

However, aetiopathological explanations for psychiatric disorders are no longer closely related to acute infection. Nevertheless, immune hypotheses have been discussed in schizophrenia, affective disorders and infantile autism in the last decades. Although the variability between the results of the epidemiological studies conducted to date is strikingly high, there is still some evidence that the immune system might play a role in the aetiopathogenesis of these three psychiatric diseases, at least in subgroups of patients. In anxiety disorders immunological research is still very much in its infancy, and the few and inconsistent data of immune changes in these patients are believed to reflect the influence of short- or long-term stress exposure. Nevertheless, there are also some hints raising the possibility that autoimmune mechanisms could interrupt neurotransmission, which would be of significance in certain patients with anxiety and panic disorders. Drug and alcohol (ethanol) dependence are not believed to be primarily influenced by an immunological aetiology. On the other hand, immune reactions due to different drugs of abuse and alcohol may directly or indirectly influence the course of concomitant somatic diseases. In different organic brain disorders the underlying somatic disease is defined as a primary immune or autoimmune disorder, for instance HIV infection or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). For other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, immunoaetiopathological mechanisms are supported by experimental and clinical studies. Treatment strategies based on immune mechanisms have been investigated in patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders. Furthermore, some antipsychotics and most antidepressants are known to have direct or indirect effects on the immune system. Different immunotherapies have been used in autism, including transfer factor, pentoxifylline, intravenous immunoglobulins and corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulating agents are well established methods for treating the neuropsychiatric sequelae of immune or autoimmune disorders, for example AIDS and SLE. Therapeutic approaches in Alzheimer's disease also apply immunological methods such as strategies of active/passive immunisation and NSAIDs.

Recent findings Recent updates regarding vaccines including the questionable link with autism, implementation of universal influenza vaccination for young children, the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine against invasive disease, and new information on pertussis, varicella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, and rotavirus vaccination are discussed. No association between measles/mumps/rubella vaccine or thimerosal-containing pertussis vaccine and autism is evident. Universal influenza vaccination for children 6 to 23 months of age will be recommended for the 2004-2005 flu season, and this implementation should reduce significant school absenteeism as well as complications seen last year including encephalopathy, seizures, respiratory failure, and pneumonia. Pneumococcal vaccine significantly reduces rates of invasive pneumococcal vaccine in healthy and HIV-infected children, although it does not appear to greatly affect otitis media rates. A reduction in post-vaccine febrile seizures appears to be present since the introduction of acellular pertussis vaccine. Multiple outbreaks in varicella have been reported since the introduction of the varicella vaccine, and a booster vaccination may be necessary in the future. Methods for detecting and preventing severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia are reviewed, as well as anticipated recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics for the detection and management of hyperbilirubinemia. High bilirubin levels in preterm infants may result in hearing dysfunction and developmental impairment. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended a higher level of monitoring for newborn jaundice and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in an effort to prevent kernicterus and sequelae from elevated bilirubin levels, including post-discharge follow-up appointment by day 3 to 5 of age. Dog bites in children with resultant post-traumatic stress disorder, rabies, and salmonellosis from pet reptiles in the home are also addressed. Clinicians need to be aware of the risk for rabies bites, need to recognize that dog bites in children appear to cause post-traumatic stress disorder in more than half of cases, and need to know how to educate patients on how to prevent salmonellosis from pet reptiles and amphibians.

A well-established cause of chemoresistance involves the family of ATP-binding cassette transporters, or ABC transporters that transport a wide range of substrates including metabolic products, nutrients, lipids, and drugs across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. Expressions of various ABC transporters, shown to reduce the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapy drugs, are increased following chemotherapy and impact on ovarian cancer survival. Although clinical trials to date using ABC transporter inhibitors have been disappointing, ABC transporter inhibition remains an attractive potential adjuvant to chemotherapy. A greater understanding of their physiological functions and role in ovarian cancer chemoresistance will be important for the development of more effective targeted therapies.

EmrE, the most studied SMR member, has presented biochemists with unusual surprises regarding its topology and raised an interesting controversy since structural information was in an apparent conflict with biochemical data. One of the reasons for the controversy was the assumption that, to ensure proper function, membrane proteins must be inserted by a mechanism that warrants a unique topology. As it turns out, EmrE and other SMR transporters display a remarkable plasticity regarding topology in the membrane, interaction between subunits, and interaction with substrates. This plasticity implies a high evolvability of these proteins and, as a consequence, a lack of commitment that facilitates acquisition of new functions and topologies.

As P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the most studied ATP-dependent efflux pumps that are frequently involved in drug efflux from cancer cells, the development of MDR modulators with the ability to inhibit P-gp efflux is considered a promising approach for overcoming MDR. However, the development of P-gp modulators have been hampered due to the absence of knowledge on the intrinsic molecular aspects by which efflux occurs, namely the specific steps that correlates drug recognition, ATP binding and efflux-related conformational changes. Experimental evidences for these processes are also difficult to obtain and only provide small pieces of information that need to be assembled for better comprehension of a wider and complex process that is drug efflux. A promising alternative relies on cutting-edge computational techniques to provide new insights on key aspects that are determinant to understand how P-gp efflux can be effectively reversed. With the contribution of ligand-based or structure-based computational methods, P-gp drug efflux is slowly becoming a dynamic and reactive process rather than a simple response to drug binding, with the complex architecture of ABC transporters playing a determinant role not only in drug recognition but in the coordination of ATP-driven conformational changes that ultimately drives drug efflux. The major enlightenments that computational studies provided toward a better comprehension of MDR and P-gp efflux phenomena are hereby described.

To address this concern, we generated an experimental electron density map from single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing of an original mouse Pgp dataset to 3.8 angstrom resolution. The map exhibited significantly more detail compared to the original MAD map and revealed several regions of the structure that required de novo model building. The improved drug-free structure was refined to 3.8 angstrom resolution with a 9.4 and 8.1% decrease in R-work and R-free, respectively, (R-work=21.2%, R-free=26.6%) and a significant improvement in protein geometry. The improved mouse Pgp model contains approximate to 95% of residues in the favorable Ramachandran region compared to only 57% for the original model. The registry of six transmembrane helices was corrected, revealing amino acid residues involved in drug binding that were previously unrecognized. Registry shifts (rotations and translations) for three transmembrane (TM)4 and TM5 and the addition of three N-terminal residues were necessary, and were validated with new mercury labeling and anomalous Fourier density. The corrected position of TM4, which forms the frame of a portal for drug entry, had backbone atoms shifted >6 angstrom from their original positions. The drug translocation pathway of mouse Pgp is 96% identical to human Pgp and is enriched in aromatic residues that likely play a collective role in allowing a high degree of polyspecific substrate recognition.

We propose that these problems can be resolved by making the following changes to the review process. Distributing reviews to many reviewers would allow each reviewer to focus on portions of the article that reflect the reviewer's specialty or area of interest and place less of a burden on any one reviewer. Providing reviewers materials and methods to perform comprehensive evaluation would facilitate transparency, greater scrutiny, and replication of results. Acknowledging reviewers makes it possible to quantitatively assess reviewer contributions, which could be used to establish the impact of the reviewer in the scientific community. Quantifying review quality could help establish the importance of individual reviews and reviewers as well as the submitted article. Finally, we recommend expediting post-publication reviews and allowing for the dialog to continue and flourish in a dynamic and interactive manner.

Highly expressed in intestine and liver, CYP and P-gp can limit the systemic-availability of parent-drug by metabolism and efflux, respectively, by means of similarly large and flexible active sites that accommodate a variety of structurally-diverse, lipophilic molecules over a wide-range of molecular weights. Consequently, many molecules that are substrates for CYP3A4 also demonstrate affinity for P-gp and numerous studies have reported that for these dual-substrates, CYP3A4 and P-gp afford an interplay that affects bioavailability and clearance in a manner that is non-linear. Several in vitro and in situ models of metabolism and permeability, including transfected cell lines, isolated tissues and perfused organs as well as computational models including physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models of such co-expressing systems have demonstrated this phenomenon of CYP3A/Pgp interplay.

In this study, a multiobjective optimisation technique based on a simple random search algorithm is deployed to dynamically infer and refine the specification of three agent-based models from their simulations. The multiobjective optimisation technique also incorporates a dynamic invariant detection technique which serves to guide the search towards uncovering new model behaviour that better captures the model specification. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) was also deployed to replace the random search algorithm, and the results from both approaches were compared.

Such programs are based on properties of native structures that are generally not expected for faulty models. One such property, which is rarely used for automatic structure quality assessment, is the tendency for conserved residues to be located at the structural core and for variable residues to be located at the surface. Results: We present ConQuass, a novel quality assessment program based on the consistency between the model structure and the protein's conservation pattern. We show that it can identify problematic structural models, and that the scores it assigns to the server models in CASP8 correlate with the similarity of the models to the native structure. We also show that when the conservation information is reliable, the method's performance is comparable and complementary to that of the other single-structure quality assessment methods that participated in CASP8 and that do not use additional structural information from homologs.

It has been suggested that this inverted symmetry is an essential element of the mechanism that allows for the conformational transitions in transporters. We show here that small multidrug transporters offer a model for the evolution of such repeats. This family includes both homodimers and closely related heterodimers. In the former, the topology determinants, evidently identical in each protomer, are weak, and we show that for EmrE, an homodimer from Escherichia coli, the insertion into the membrane is random, and dimers are functional whether they insert into the cytoplasmic membrane with the N- and C-terminal domains facing the inside or the outside of the cell. Also, mutants designed to insert with biased topology are functional regardless of the topology. In the case of EbrAB, a heterodimer homologue supposed to interact antiparallel, we show that one of the subunits, EbrB, can also function as a homodimer, most likely in a parallel mode. In addition, the EmrE homodimer can be forced to an antiparallel topology by fusion of an additional transmembrane segment. The simplicity of the mechanism of coupling ion and substrate transport and the few requirements for substrate recognition provide the robustness necessary to tolerate such a unique and unprecedented ambiguity in the interaction of the subunits and in the dimer topology relative to the membrane. The results suggest that the small multidrug transporters are at an evolutionary junction and provide a model for the evolution of structure of transport proteins.",NA,NA,NA,"Schuldiner, Shimon/F-7628-2012","Schuldiner, Shimon/0000-0002-4874-6237",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0021-9258",NA,NA,NA,NA,"14-May",2010,"285","20",NA,NA,NA,NA,"15234","15244",NA,"10.1074/jbc.M110.108746",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000277399000044",20308069,3,"3 no 37"

ATP-binding cassette transporters harness the free energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to drive the uphill translocation of substrates against their concentration gradients. A model of protein motion coupling energy input to work was inspired by crystallographic snapshots of MsbA. Central to this model is a switch in the accessibility of a transmembrane chamber, implicated in substrate binding, from an inward- to an outward-facing configuration. Here, we used spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to systematically explore rearrangements in MsbA structure during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Spin-label accessibility and local dynamics were determined in liposomes for the nucleotide-free intermediate and the transition state of ATP hydrolysis. The changes in the electron paramagnetic resonance parameters between these two intermediates fit a global pattern consistent with alternating access of the chamber. In the transition state of ATP hydrolysis, spin labels on the cytoplasmic side report increased dynamic restrictions and reduced water accessibility, while those on the extracellular side report increased water penetration. Furthermore, spin-label mobility and accessibility as well as their changes are consistent with those expected based on the crystal structures. The reversal in chamber hydration is likely to reduce the free energy of amphipathic substrate binding and promote translocation across the membrane. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of single spin-labeled cysteine mutants suggests that, in the resting state, this sub-domain essentially adopts a partially extended conformation, which is consistent with the crystal structures of MsbA and Sav1866. Interestingly, one of the single point mutants (Q333C) yielded an immobilized EPR spectrum that could arise from a direct interaction with a vicinal tyrosine residue. Inspection of different BmrA models pointed to Y408, within the NBD, as the putative interacting partner, and its mutation to a Phe residue indeed dramatically modified the EPR spectra of the spin labeled Q333C. Moreover, unlike the Y408F mutation, the Y408A mutation abolished both ATPase activity and drug transport of BmrA, suggesting that a nonpolar bulky residue is required at this position. The spatial proximity of Q333 and Y408 was also confirmed by formation of a disulfide bond when both Q333 and T407 (or S409) were replaced jointly by a cysteine residue.

The most favoured interpretation of the structure was that the monomers were oriented in opposite orientations in the membrane in an antiparallel orientation. A model was subsequently built based upon the cryo-EM data and evolutionary constraints and this model was consistent with mutagenic data indicating which amino-acid residues were important for substrate binding and transport. Two X-ray structures that differed significantly from the cryo-EM structure were subsequently retracted owing to a data-analysis error. However, the revised X-ray structure with substrate bound is extremely similar to the model built from the cryoEM structure (r.m.s.d. of 1.4 angstrom), suggesting that the proposed antiparallel orientation of the monomers is indeed correct; this represents a new structural paradigm in membrane-protein structures.

This protein extrudes a large range of components out of cells, especially therapeutic agents causing a phenomenon known as multidrug resistance. Because of its clinical interest, its activity and transport function have been largely characterized by various biochemical studies. In the absence of a high-resolution structure of P-glycoprotein, homology modeling is a useful tool to help interpretation of experimental data and potentially guide experimental studies. Results: We present here three-dimensional models of two different catalytic states of P-glycoprotein that were developed based on the crystal structures of two bacterial multidrug transporters. Our models are supported by a large body of biochemical data. Measured inter-residue distances correlate well with distances derived from cross-linking data. The nucleotide-free model features a large cavity detected in the protein core into which ligands of different size were successfully docked. The locations of docked ligands compare favorably with those suggested by drug binding site mutants. Conclusion: Our models can interpret the effects of several mutants in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), within the transmembrane domains (TMDs) or at the NBD: TMD interface. The docking results suggest that the protein has multiple binding sites in agreement with experimental evidence. The nucleotide-bound models are exploited to propose different pathways of signal transmission upon ATP binding/hydrolysis which could lead to the elaboration of conformational changes needed for substrate translocation. We identified a cluster of aromatic residues located at the interface between the NBD and the TMD in opposite halves of the molecule which may contribute to this signal transmission.

In the past five years, many researchers have built homology models of ABC extrusion systems using the atomic coordinates of crystallized MsbA, a lipopolysaccharide transporter in Gram-negative bacteria. Likewise, we have previously used the Vibrio cholera MsbA structure as a template in the modeling of the multidrug transporter LmrA from Lactococcus lactis. In view of the recently discovered inaccuracies in the MsbA structure, we have remodelled LmrA using the atomic coordinates of the MsbA homologue Sav1866 from Staphylococcus aureus. To compare and test our MsbA-based and Sav1866-based LmrA models we performed cysteine cross-linking at three key positions in LmrA. The pattern of cross-linking at these positions was consistent with the overall topology of transmembrane helices in Sav1866, suggesting that its crystal structure might be physiologically relevant. We recently identified E314 as a residue important in proton conduction by LmrA. The predicted location of this residue at the interface between the two half- transporters in the Sav1866-based homodimer, within the inner leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer, provides a new structural basis for the role of E314 in LmrA-mediated transport.

The ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporters human P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and the human MRP5 (ABCC5) are involved in multidrug resistance. Results: In order to elucidate structural and molecular concepts of multidrug resistance, we have constructed a molecular model of the ATP-bound outward facing conformation of the human multidrug resistance protein ABCB1 using the Sav1866 crystal structure as a template, and compared the ABCB1 model with a previous ABCC5 model. The electrostatic potential surface (EPS) of the ABCB1 substrate translocation chamber, which transports cationic amphiphilic and lipophilic substrates, was neutral with negative and weakly positive areas. In contrast, EPS of the ABCC5 substrate translocation chamber, which transports organic anions, was generally positive. Positive-negative ratios of amino acids in the TMDs of ABCB1 and ABCC5 were also analyzed, and the positive-negative ratio of charged amino acids was higher in the ABCC5 TMDs than in the ABCB1 TMDs.

Moreover, Slitrks required distinct members of the leukocyte antigen-related receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (LAR-RPTP) family to trigger synapse formation. Protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTP sigma), in particular, was specifically required for excitatory synaptic differentiation by Slitrks, whereas PTP delta was necessary for inhibitory synapse differentiation.

Rem2 is a member of the RGK ((R) under bar ad, (R) under bar em, (R) under bar em2, (G) under bar em/(K) under bar ir) subfamily of small GTPases that confers potent inhibition upon VGCCs. The physiologic roles of RGK proteins, particularly in the brain, are poorly r understood. Rem2 was implicated in synaptogenesis through an RNAi screen and proposed to regulate Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons. To test this hypothesis and uncover physiological roles for Rem2 in the brain, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Rem2 knockdown affected synaptogenesis and Ca2+ homeostasis in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Expression of a cocktail of shRNAs targeting rat Rem2 (rRem2) reduced the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) measured 10 d after transfection (14 d in vitro), but did not affect mEPSC amplitude. VGCC current amplitude, after rRem2-targeted knockdown was not different from that in control cells, however, a either 4 or 10 d Po transfection. Co-expression of a human Rem2 that was insensitive to the shRNAs targeting rRem2 was unable to prevent the reduction in mEPSC frequency after rRem2-targeted knockdown. Over-expression of rRem2 resulted in 50% reduction in VGCC current, but neither the mEPSC frequency nor amplitude was affected. Taken together, the observed effects upon synaptogenesis after shRNA treatment are more likely due to mechanisms other than modulation of VGCCs and Ca2+ homeostasis, and may be independent of Rem2.

As a result, 12 hits were identified including FGFR1 (FGF receptor 1), TrkB, and TrkC as well as components of the MAPK and mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR) pathways. For confirmation, the impact of these hits on gephyrin clustering was analyzed in rat primary hippocampal neurons. We found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) acts on gephyrin clustering through MAPK signaling, and this process may be controlled by the MAPK signaling antagonist sprouty2. BDNF signaling through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt also activates mTOR and represses GSK3 beta, which was previously shown to reduce gephyrin clustering. Gephyrin is associated with inactive mTOR and becomes released upon BDNF-dependent mTOR activation. In primary neurons, a reduction in the number of gephyrin clusters due to manipulation of the BDNF-mTOR signaling is associated with reduced GABA(A) receptor clustering, suggesting functional impairment of GABA signaling. Accordingly, application of the mTOR antagonist rapamycin leads to disinhibition of neuronal networks as measured on microelectrode arrays.

The function of KCC2 is suppressed under several pathological conditions including neuronal trauma, different types of epilepsies, axotomy of motoneurons, neuronal inflammations and ischaemic insults. However, it remains unclear how down-regulation of the KCC2 contributes to neuronal survival during and after toxic stress. Here we show that in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures the suppression of the KCC2 function using two different shRNAs, dominant-negative KCC2 mutant C568A or DIOA inhibitor, increased the intracellular chloride concentration [Cl-](i) and enhanced the toxicity induced by lipofectamine-dependent oxidative stress or activation of the NMDA receptors. The rescuing of the KCC2 activity using over-expression of the active form of the KCC2, but not its non-active mutant Y1087D, effectively restored [Cl-](i) and enhanced neuronal resistance to excitotoxicity.

To elucidate the molecular interaction network of endogenous Lrrk2 under stoichiometric constraints, we applied QUICK (quantitative immunoprecipitation combined with knockdown) in NIH3T3 cells. The identified interactome reveals actin isoforms as well as actin-associated proteins involved in actin filament assembly, organization, rearrangement, and maintenance, suggesting that the biological function of Lrrk2 is linked to cytoskeletal dynamics.

In this study, we assessed the role of enhanced artemin/GFR alpha 3 levels on the changes in mouse cutaneous CH neurons following saphenous nerve regeneration.

The orphan G protein-coupled receptor, GPR30, was recently shown to bind oestrogens and to trigger rapid signalling in vitro, and is expressed in several rat and human brain regions, including the hypothalamus. We used two complementary approaches to investigate the role of GPR30 in hypothalamic responses to E(2) that are relevant to reproductive physiology. Serial blood sampling after the acute administration of the selective GPR30 agonist G1 was used to assess the role of GPR30 in short latency negative-feedback inhibition of luteinising hormone (LH) secretion and facilitation of prolactin secretion in ovariohysterectomised female rats. In vivo RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by adeno-associated virus-expressing small hairpin RNA (shRNA) infused into the mediobasal hypothalamus, was used to study the effects of GPR30 knockdown on these rapid responses to E(2). Longer-term actions of E(2) on female sexual behaviour (lordosis) were also examined in female rats subjected to in vivo RNAi. Administration of E(2) or G1 triggered a short latency surge of prolactin secretion, and animals subjected to GPR30 RNAi showed significantly less E(2)-dependent prolactin release than animals receiving control virus. G1 did not mimic E(2) negative-feedback inhibition of LH secretion, and GPR30 RNAi did not interfere with E(2) suppression of LH or facilitation of lordosis behaviour. These findings suggest that activation of GPR30 promotes short latency prolactin secretion but does not mediate E(2) negative-feedback inhibition of LH secretion or E(2) facilitation of female reproductive behaviour.",NA,NA,NA,"Reyna-Neyra,  Andrea/F-5621-2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0953-8194",NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2009,"21","9",NA,NA,NA,NA,"743","752",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2826.2009.01893.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000269187600002",19523168,4,"4 no 36"

While they are key mediators of synaptic plasticity, they are also known to function in axon guidance, albeit by mechanisms that are yet to be elucidated. Homer proteins couple extracellular receptors - such as metabotropic glutamate receptors and the transient receptor potential canonical family of cation channels - to intracellular receptors such as inositol triphosphate and ryanodine receptors on intracellular calcium stores and, therefore, are well placed to regulate calcium dynamics within the neural growth cone. Here we used growth cones from dorsal root ganglia, a well established model in the field of axon guidance, and a growth cone turning assay to examine Homer1 function in axon guidance. Results: Homer1 knockdown reversed growth cone turning from attraction to repulsion in response to the calcium-dependent guidance cues brain derived neurotrophic factor and netrin-1. Conversely, Homer1 knockdown had no effect on repulsion to the calcium-independent guidance cue Semaphorin-3A. This reversal of attractive turning suggested a requirement for Homer1 in a molecular switch. Pharmacological experiments confirmed that the operational state of a calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II/calcineurin phosphatase molecular switch was dependent on Homer1 expression. Calcium imaging of motile growth cones revealed that Homer1 is required for guidance-cue-induced rise of cytosolic calcium and the attenuation of spontaneous cytosolic calcium transients. Homer1 knockdown-induced calcium transients and turning were inhibited by antagonists of store-operated channels. In addition, immunocytochemistry revealed the close association of Homer1 with the store-operated proteins TRPC1 and STIM1 within dorsal root ganglia growth cones. Conclusion: These experiments provide evidence that Homer1 is an essential component of the calcium signalling repertoire within motile growth cones, regulating guidance-cue-induced calcium release and maintaining basal cytosolic calcium.",NA,NA,NA,"Choi-Lundberg, Derek/J-7670-2014; Gasperini, Rob/J-7804-2014","Choi-Lundberg, Derek/0000-0002-3594-8585;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1749-8104",NA,NA,NA,NA,"03-Aug",2009,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"29","10.1186/1749-8104-4-29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000269954800001",19650914,4,"4 no 37"

Using coimmunoprecipitation, we found that Reelin interacted with APP through the central domain of Reelin (repeats 3-6) and the E1 extracellular domain of APP. Reelin increased cell surface levels of APP and decreased endocytosis of APP in hippocampal neurons in vitro. In vivo, Reelin levels were increased in brains of APP knock-out mice and decreased in APP-overexpressing mice.

Here, we show that neurite growth in immortalized and primary neurons responds in pleiotropic ways to changes in spastin levels. Spastin depletion alters the development of primary hippocampal neurons leading to abnormal neuron morphology, dystrophic neurites, and axonal growth defects. By live imaging with End-Binding Protein 3-Fluorescent Green Protein (EB3-GFP), a MT plus-end tracking protein, we ascertained that the assembly rate of MTs is reduced when spastin is down-regulated. Spastin over-expression at high levels strongly suppresses neurite maintenance, while slight spastin up-regulation using an endogenous promoter enhances neurite branching and elongation. Spastin severing activity is exerted preferentially on stable acetylated and detyrosinated MTs.

To further test the role of Sox11 in an in vivo system, we developed a new approach to specifically target small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) conjugated to the membrane permeable molecule Penetratin to injured sensory afferents. Injection of Sox11 siRNAs into the mouse saphenous nerve caused a transient knockdown of Sox11 mRNA that transiently inhibited in vivo regeneration. Electron microscopic level analysis of Sox11 RNAi-injected nerves showed that regeneration of myelinated and unmyelinated axons was inhibited. Nearly all neurons in ganglia of crushed nerves that were Sox11 immunopositive showed colabeling for the stress and injury-associated activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). In addition, treatment with Sox11 siRNAs in vitro and in vivo caused a transcriptional and translational level reduction in ATF3 expression.

A few years ago, a new neuroprotective gene, i.e. seladin-1 (for selective AD indicator-1), was identified and found to be down-regulated in AD vulnerable brain regions. Seladin-1 inhibits the activation of caspase-3, a key modulator of apoptosis. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the seladin-1 gene encodes 3 beta-hydroxysterol Delta 24-reductase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cholesterol from desmosterol. We have demonstrated previously that in fetal neuroepithelial cells, 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta E(2)), raloxifene, and tamoxifen exert neuroprotective effects and increase the expression of seladin-1. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether seladin-1 is directly involved in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection. Using the small interfering RNA methodology, significantly reduced levels of seladin-1 mRNA and protein were obtained in fetal neuroepithelial cells. Seladin-1 silencing determined the loss of the protective effect of 17 beta E(2) against beta-amyloid and oxidative stress toxicity and caspase-3 activation. A computer-assisted analysis revealed the presence of half-palindromic estrogen responsive elements upstream from the coding region of the seladin-1 gene. A 1490-bp region was cloned in a luciferase reporter vector, which was transiently cotransfected with the estrogen receptor alpha in Chinese hamster ovarian cells. The exposure to 17 beta E(2), raloxifene, tamoxifen, and the soy isoflavones genistein and zearalenone increased luciferase activity, thus suggesting a functional role for the half-estrogen responsive elements of the seladin-1 gene.

To determine the role of the NR1 subunit gene in the amygdala with respect to physical and psychological opioid withdrawal, a spatial-temporal deletion of this gene was produced by microinjecting a recombinant adeno-associated Virus (rAAV) expressing the GFP reporter and Cre recombinase (rAAV-GFP-Cre) into the CeA of adult ""floxed"" NR1 mice (fNR1). Amygdala microinjection of rAAV-GFP-Cre produced a decrease in NR1 gene expression and protein immunolabeling in postsynaptic sites of neurons Without signs of compromised ultrastructural neuronal morphology. Amygdala NR1 gene deletion also did not affect locomotor, somatosensory, or sensory-motor behaviors. In addition, bilateral local NR1 gene deletion did not impact somatic or visceral withdrawal symptoms precipitated by naloxone in morphine-dependent mice. However, there was a significant deficit in the expression of an opioid withdrawal-induced conditioned place aversion in mice with amygdala NR1 deletion.

By silencing endogenous neuroligin-1 acutely in the amygdala of live behaving animals, we have found that neuroligin-1 is required for the storage of associative fear memory. Subsequent cellular physiological studies showed that suppression of neuroligin-1 reduces NMDA receptor-mediated currents and prevents the expression of long-term potentiation without affecting basal synaptic connectivity at the thalamo-amygdala pathway.

With this promise of RNAi to control pathogens and vectors, this paper reviews the current status of RNAi in protozoans, animal parasitic helminths and disease-transmitting vectors, such as insects. Many pathogens and vectors cause severe parasitic diseases in tropical regions and it is difficult to control once the host has been invaded. Intracellularly, RNAi can be highly effective in impeding parasitic development and proliferation within the host. To fully realize its potential as a means to control tropical diseases, appropriate delivery methods for RNAi should be developed, and possible off-target effects should be minimized for specific gene suppression.

When neurons reach their final destinations, however, somal translocation and axon extension are uncoupled. Insights into the mechanisms underlying this process of disengagement came from our study of the behaviour of embryonic spinal motor neurons following ablation of boundary cap cells. These are neural crest derivatives that transiently reside at motor exit points, central nervous system (CNS): peripheral nervous system (PNS) interfaces where motor axons leave the CNS. In the absence of boundary cap cells, motor neuron cell bodies migrate along their axons into the periphery, suggesting that repellent signals from boundary cap cells regulate the selective gating of somal migration and axon outgrowth at the motor exit point. Here we used RNA interference in the chick embryo together with analysis of null mutant mice to identify possible boundary cap cell ligands, their receptors on motor neurons and cytoplasmic signalling molecules that control this process. Results: We demonstrate that targeted knock down in motor neurons of Neuropilin-2 (Npn-2), a high affinity receptor for class 3 semaphorins, causes their somata to migrate to ectopic positions in ventral nerve roots. This finding was corroborated in Npn-2 null mice, in which we identified motor neuron cell bodies in ectopic positions in the PNS. Our RNA interference studies further revealed a role for Plexin-A2, but not Plexin-A1 or Plexin-A4. We show that chick and mouse boundary cap cells express Sema3B and 3G, secreted semaphorins, and Sema6A, a transmembrane semaphorin. However, no increased numbers of ectopic motor neurons are found in Sema3B null mouse embryos. In contrast, Sema6A null mice display an ectopic motor neuron phenotype. Finally, knockdown of MICAL3, a downstream semaphorin/Plexin-A signalling molecule, in chick motor neurons led to their ectopic positioning in the PNS. Conclusion: We conclude that semaphorin-mediated repellent interactions between boundary cap cells and immature spinal motor neurons regulates somal positioning by countering the drag exerted on motor neuron cell bodies by their axons as they emerge from the CNS at motor exit points. Our data support a model in which BC cell semaphorins signal through Npn-2 and/or Plexin-A2 receptors on motor neurons via a cytoplasmic effector, MICAL3, to trigger cytoskeletal reorganisation.

Accordingly, deletion of neuroligin-1 in knockout mice selectively decreases the NMDAR/AMPAR ratio, whereas deletion of neuroligin-2 selectively decreases inhibitory synaptic responses. Strikingly, chronic inhibition of NMDARs or CaM-Kinase 11, which signals downstream of NMDARs, suppresses the synapse-boosting activity of neuroligin-1, whereas chronic inhibition of general synaptic activity suppresses the synapse-boosting activity of neuroligin-2.

Due to its remarkable discriminating properties, individual genes, or even alleles can be targeted with exquisite specificity in cultured cells or living animals. Among its many potential biomedical applications, silencing of disease-linked genes stands out as a promising therapeutic strategy for many incurable disorders. Neurodegenerative diseases represent one of the more attractive targets for the development of therapeutic RNAi. In this group of diseases, the progressive loss of neurons leads to the gradual appearance of disabling neurological symptoms and premature death. Currently available therapies aim to improve the symptoms but not to halt the process of neurodegeneration. The increasing prevalence and economic burden of some of these diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD), has boosted the efforts invested in the development of interventions, such as RNAi, aimed at altering their natural course. This review will summarize where we stand in the therapeutic application of RNAi for neurodegenerative diseases. The basic principles of RNAi will be reviewed, focusing on features important for its therapeutic manipulation. Subsequently, a stepwise strategy for the development of therapeutic RNAi will be presented. Finally, the different preclinical trials of therapeutic RNAi completed in disease models will be summarized, stressing the experimental questions that need to be addressed before planning application in human disease.

This chapter describes two protein-based inactivation approaches called chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI) and fluorophore-assisted light inactivation (FALI). For CALI and FALI, light inactivation is targeted via photosensitizers that are localized to proteins of interest through antibody binding or expressed domains that are fluorescent or bind fluorescent probes. Inactivation occurs when and where the cells or tissues are irradiated and thus CALI and FALI provide an unprecedented level of spatial and temporal resolution of protein inactivation. Here we provide methods for the labeling of antibodies and setup of light sources and discuss controls, advantages of the technology, and potential pitfalls.

The present results of electrophysiological and biochemical studies indicated that PGE(2) is actually produced in acute visual cortex slices in response to thetabust stimulation (TBS) and is involved postsynaptically in TBS-induced LTP. RNA interference (RNAi) for PGE(2) receptor subtypes EP2 and EP3, which are known to upregulate and downregulate the level of cAMP, respectively, induced significant decreases and increases of LTP, respectively. Moreover, analysis of the localization of receptor subtypes at the membrane surface or cytosol showed that stimuli such as TBS regulate the trafficking of EP2 and EP3 between the membrane and cytosol of the postsynapses, rising up to and leaving the membrane, respectively, resulting in increased and decreased expression of EP2 and EP3 at the membrane, respectively. Increased activation of EP2 and decreased activation of EP3 by PGE(2) synergistically induce an increase in cAMP level, which may induce LTP. This causes activation of CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) in the postsynaptic cells, which may be involved in the maintenance of LTP. These observations indicate that in TBS-induced LTP of the visual cortex, PGE(2) is released from the postsynaptic cells and then activates PGE(2) receptors at the postsynaptic membranes, which is regulated by trafficking of the differential PGE(2) receptor subtypes in an activity-dependent bidirectional manner.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0270-6474",NA,NA,NA,NA,"04-Oct",2006,"26","40",NA,NA,NA,NA,"10209","10221",NA,"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3028-06.2006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000241192700014",17021176,4,"4 no 69"

Efficacy was assessed by measuring patients' visual analog scale (VAS) score for elbow pain, modified Mayo clinic performance index for the elbow, and by evaluating longitudinal and transverse ultrasound images of tendon defect areas after 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. No significant adverse effects of allo-ASC injection were observed through 52 weeks of follow-up. From baseline through 52 weeks of periodic follow-up, VAS scores progressively decreased from 66.8+/-14.5 mm to 14.8+/-13.1 mm and elbow performance scores improved from 64.0+/-13.5 to 90.6+/-5.8. Tendon defects also significantly decreased through this period. Allo-ASC therapy was thus safe and effective in improving elbow pain, performance, and structural defects for 52 weeks.

The regenerative potential of MSCs has been widely studied in the context of ischemic or mechanical forms of tissue damage, and these stem cells may also constitute a powerful means of treating tissue lesions caused by ionizing radiation, either after accidental exposure to radioactivity or as a side effect of clinical radiotherapy. Animal studies and early clinical experiences suggest a role for MSCs in the regeneration of these tissue lesions both by differentiating into functional parenchymal cells and by creating a nurturing microenvironment for other cells. Here, we review the published data on the regenerative properties of MSCs in the context of organ-specific radiation damage.

There is still, however, a need for further investigation to improve the knowledge of stem cell biology, to broaden their field of use, and to enhance their therapeutic effectiveness. Methods: The authors characterized human adipose-derived stem cells at different in vitro culture time points in terms of immunophenotype, multilineage differentiation, long-term survival with self-renewal capacity, and presence of telomere maintenance mechanisms (telomerase activity and alternative lengthening of telomere) for excluding their eventual susceptibility to malignant transformation. Results: Adipose-derived stem cells were isolated from the abdomen and peritrochanteric region of 31 female donors, propagated, and monitored in vitro for several passages. The outgrown cells shared the biological properties of mesenchymal stem cells, with adherence to plastic, expression of the typical surface markers, and induction of adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation.

Adipose tissue of healthy individuals was used for isolation and expansion of ASCs. Chromosome copy numbers were studied using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Aneuploidy was studied in freshly isolated ASCs, in ASCs cultured for 0-16 passages and in senescent cultures. To evaluate the plasticity of ploidy, ASCs were cloned, and the variation of ploidy in the clones was examined. Tumorigenicity was studied by subcutaneous injection of aneuploid ASCs in immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice. Results. No aneuploidy was detected in freshly isolated ASCs. In low passages (passages 0-4), aneuploidy was detected in 3.4% of ASCs. Prolonged culture expansion of ASCs (passages 5-16) resulted in a significant increase of aneuploidy to 7.1%. With senescence, aneuploidy increased further to 19.8%. Aneuploidy was observed in clones of diploid ASCs, demonstrating the de novo development of aneuploidy. No transformation of ASCs was observed, and in contrast to cancer cell lines, aneuploid ASCs were incapable of tumor formation in immunodeficient mice. Conclusions. ASC cultures contain a stable percentage of aneuploid cells. Aneuploidy was not a predecessor of transformation or tumor formation.

Stem cell treatment in orthopaedics for joint pathology is promising since these cells have the ability to modulate different processes in the various tissues of the joint simultaneously. The non life-threatening nature of musculoskeletal system disorders makes safety of stem cell therapy a necessary prerequisite. Objective: To systematically review the literature and provide an overview of reported adverse events (AEs) of intra-articular treatment with culture-expanded stem cells in humans. Design: A systematic literature search was performed in Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CINAHL in February 2013. AEs were reported into three categories: local/systemic, serious adverse event or AE (SAE/AE), related/unrelated. Results: 3039 Potentially eligible articles were identified of which eventually eight fulfilled our inclusion criteria. In total, 844 procedures with a mean follow-up of 21 months were analysed. Autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were used for cartilage repair and osteoarthritis treatment in all included studies. Four SAEs were reported by the authors. One infection following bone marrow aspiration (BMA) was reported as probably related and resolved with antibiotics. One pulmonary embolism occurred 2 weeks after BMA and was reported as possibly related. Two tumours, both not at the site of injection, were reported as unrelated. Twenty-two other cases of possible procedure-related and seven of possible stem cell-product related adverse events (AEs) were documented. The main AEs related to the procedure were increased pain/swelling and dehydration after BMA. Increased pain and swelling was the only AE reported as related to the stem cell-product. Conclusions: Based on current literature review we conclude that application of cultured stem cells in joints appears to be safe. We believe that with continuous caution for potential side effects, it is reasonable to continue with the development of articular stem cell therapies.

After isolation of ASC from human lipoaspirates of seven patients, in vitro expansion over 10 passages was performed. Cells from passages 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 were used for the alkaline single-cell microgel electrophoresis (comet) assay to detect DNA single-strand breaks and alkali labile as well as incomplete excision repair sites. Chromosomal changes were examined by means of the chromosomal aberration test. Results. During in vitro expansion, ASC showed no DNA single-strand breaks in the comet assay. With the chromosomal aberration test, however, a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations were detected. Conclusions. The study showed that although no DNA fragmentation could be determined, the safety of ASC cannot be ensured with respect to chromosome stability during in vitro expansion.

Their use in a therapeutic context requires large-scale in vitro expansion, increasing the probability of genetic and epigenetic instabilities. Some evidence shows that an organized program of replicative senescence is triggered in human BM-MSCs (hBM-MSCs) on prolonged in vitro expansion that includes alterations in phenotype, differentiation potential, telomere length, proliferation rates, global gene-expression patterns, and DNA methylation profiles. Methods: In this study, we monitored the chromosomal status, the biologic behavior, and the senescence state of hBM-MSCs derived from eight healthy donors at different passages during in vitro propagation. For a more complete picture, the telomere length was also monitored in five of eight donors, whereas the genomic profile was evaluated in three of eight donors by array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). Finally, an epigenomic profile was delineated and compared between early and late passages, by pooling DNA of hBM-MSCs from four donors. Results: Our data indicate that long-term culture severely affects the characteristics of hBM-MSCs. All the observed changes (that is, enlarged morphology, decreased number of cell divisions, random loss of genomic regions, telomere shortening) might be regulated by epigenetic modifications. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that specific biologic processes of hBM-MSCs are affected by variations in DNA methylation from early to late passages. Conclusions: Because we revealed a significant decrease in DNA methylation levels in hBM-MSCs during long-term culture, it is very important to unravel how these modifications can influence the biologic features of hBM-MSCs to keep track of this organized program and also to clarify the conflicting observations on hBM-MSC malignant transformation in the literature.",NA,NA,NA,"Baronchelli, Simona/G-6771-2016;","Baronchelli, Simona/0000-0002-1857-1472; Bentivegna, Angela/0000-0001-7535-846X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1757-6512",NA,NA,NA,NA,"20-Nov",2012,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"47","10.1186/scrt138",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000313167900001",23168092,5,"5 no 33"

The potential of stem cell therapies has long been recognised and the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) has boosted the stem cell field leading to increasing development and scientific knowledge. Despite the clinical potential of stem cell based medicinal products there are also potential and unanticipated risks. These risks deserve a thorough discussion within the perspective of current scientific knowledge and experience. Evaluation of potential risks should be a prerequisite step before clinical use of stem cell based medicinal products. The risk profile of stem cell based medicinal products depends on many risk factors, which include the type of stem cells, their differentiation status and proliferation capacity, the route of administration, the intended location, in vitro culture and/or other manipulation steps, irreversibility of treatment, need/possibility for concurrent tissue regeneration in case of irreversible tissue loss, and long-term survival of engrafted cells. Together these factors determine the risk profile associated with a stem cell based medicinal product. The identified risks (i.e. risks identified in clinical experience) or potential/theoretical risks (i.e. risks observed in animal studies) include tumour formation, unwanted immune responses and the transmission of adventitious agents. Currently, there is no clinical experience with pluripotent stem cells (i.e. embryonal stem cells and iPSC). Based on their characteristics of unlimited self-renewal and high proliferation rate the risks associated with a product containing these cells (e. g. risk on tumour formation) are considered high, if not perceived to be unacceptable.

To enhance magnetization, graphene was treated with 3-mercatopropionic acid followed by coating with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped ZnO2 nanoparticles. Interestingly coating of graphene over ZnO2 does not enhance magnetization, whereas coating of 15-20% ZnO2 nanoparticles over graphene enhances magnetization more than 30 times, which gradually decreases on increasing concentration of ZnO2 nanoparticles. Such coated graphene shows highest saturation of magnetization at room temperature ever reported in graphene (130 memu g(-1)).

However, if both Ge quantum dots and Ge/SiO2 multilayer films were able to form ordered magnetic states without the contribution of extrinsic inclusions, the induced ferromagnetism would be certainly incompatible with our knowledge of magnetism in physics. We therefore reinitiate an investigation in order to examine the validity of their claims.

It was the purpose of the present paper to look more critically into some conjectures which have been made and to the peculiar and contradictory experimental results in this rather indistinct and disputable field. First the basic physics of magnetism was briefly addressed. Then a few basic questions were thoroughly analyzed and critically reconsidered to elucidate the possible relevant mechanism (if any) which may be responsible for observed peculiarities of the ""magnetic"" behavior in these systems. The arguments supporting the existence of the intrinsic magnetism in carbon-based materials, including pure graphene were analyzed critically. It was concluded that recently published works have shown that the results of the previous studies, where the ""ferromagnetism"" was detected in pure graphene, were incorrect. Rather, graphene is strongly diamagnetic, similar to graphite. Thus the possible traces of a quasi-magnetic behavior which some authors observed in their samples may be attributed rather to induced magnetism due to the impurities, defects, etc. On the basis of the present analysis the conclusion was made that the thorough and detailed experimental studies of these problems only may shed light on the very complicated problem of the magnetism of carbon-based materials.

It is shown that in all these cases above the JTE are ""hidden"" in the excited states of the undistorted configuration even when the energy gap to these states is very large, and the involvement of these states in the vibronic coupling explains the JT origin of the distortions. This confirms the general validity of the HE as the only source of instabilities and distortions of high-symmetry configurations of polyatomic systems. For the example of the ozone molecule, which has no degenerate ground state, neither in the distorted (obtuse-triangular), nor in the undistorted (regular triangular) configurations, and there are no low-lying excited states, the distortion is shown to emerge from the HE in the excited E state situated at similar to 8.3 eV above the ground state. The JT stabilization energy is more than similar to 9 eV which makes the distorted configuration the lowest in energy. For molecular systems with half-closed-shell electronic configurations e(2) and t(3) (with degenerate orbitals), which produce totally symmetric charge distribution and are not subject to the JTE (neither in the ground high-spin (HS) state, nor in the excited low-spin (LS) states formed from these configurations by interelectron interaction), distortions were shown to occur due to a strong PJT mixing of two excited states. Again, the PIT stabilization energy in these cases is larger than the energy gap to the ground state, so the low-spin excited state of the undistorted geometry becomes the lowest in energy in the distorted configuration, and it is shown that this distortion is accompanied by orbital disproportionation that makes the charge distribution lower in symmetry. Since the two spin-states are stable in two different nuclear configurations, distorted (LS) and undistorted (HS), a novel phenomenon emerges in these systems: JT-induced spin-crossover. Distinguished from the known spin-crossover in transition metal compounds, the JT-induced spin-crossover takes place in a large variety of molecular systems from different classes including organic compounds, and it has a much lower rate of relaxation between the two states; this makes them candidates for single-molecule materials for electronic devices.

Surveys suggest that nowadays approximately 10% of the male and 15% of the female population suffer from urinary incontinence at some stage in their lifetime. In women, two major etiologies contribute to SUI: degeneration of the urethral sphincter muscle controlling the closing mechanism of the bladder outflow and changes in lower pelvic organ position associated with degeneration of connective tissue or with mechanical stress, including obesity and load and tissue injury during pregnancy and delivery. In males, the reduction of the sphincter muscle function is sometimes due to surgical interventions as a consequence of prostate cancer treatment, benign prostate hyperplasia, or of neuropathical origin. Accordingly, for women and men different therapies were developed. In some cases, SUI can be treated by physical exercise, electrophysiological stimulation, and pharmacological interventions. If this fails to improve the situation, surgical interventions are required. In standard procedures, endoprostheses for mechanical support of the weakened tissue or mechanical valves for a bladder outflow control are implanted. In 20% of cases treated, repeat procedures are required as implants yield all sorts of side effects in time. Based on preclinical studies, the application of an advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) such as implantation of autologous cells may be a curative and long-lasting therapy for SUI.

Because SUI is mainly due to urethral sphincter deficiency, several preclinical and clinical trials have investigated whether transplantation of patient's own skeletal muscle-derived cells (SkMDCs) can restore the sphincter musculature. The specific cell type of SkMDCs has been described as myoblasts, satellite cells, muscle progenitor cells, or muscle-derived stem cells, and thus may vary from study to study. In more recent years, other stem cell (SC) types have also been tested, including those from the bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and adipose tissue. These studies were mostly preclinical and utilized rat SUI models that were established predominantly by pudendal or sciatic nerve injury. Less frequently used animal models were sphincter injury and vaginal distension. While transurethral injection of SCs was employed almost exclusively in clinical trials, periurethral injection was used in all preclinical trials. Intravenous injection was also used in one preclinical study. Functional assessment of therapeutic efficacy in preclinical studies has relied almost exclusively on leak point pressure measurement. Histological assessment examined the sphincter muscle content, existence of transplanted SCs, and possible differentiation of these SCs.

Methods: The peer-reviewed literature consisting of relevant clinical and animal studies on the topic of SUI was surveyed and reviewed. Results: Animal studies have demonstrated the potential utility of SCs in promoting functional recovery of the urethra after simulated childbirth injury. Research in animals suggests similar urethral recovery after injection of bone marrow derived mesenchymal SC secretions as after injection of the SCs themselves. Therefore, whether the improvements result from the injection of the SCs themselves or from their secretion of specific proteins is unclear. Early clinical trials have demonstrated the feasibility and short-term safety of injecting muscle-derived SCs into the urethra to treat SUI. Conclusions: Larger and longer-term clinical trials are needed. Nonetheless, efficacious SC-based therapy for the treatment of SUI is practical, achievable and should be available as a treatment modality in the near future. Neurourol. Urodynam. 31:386-389, 2012.

Objectives To assess the effects of periurethral or transurethral injection therapy on the cure or improvement of urinary incontinence in women. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 8 November 2010) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatment for urinary incontinence in which at least one management arm involved periurethral or transurethral injection therapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality of each study using explicit criteria. Data extraction was undertaken independently and clarification concerning possible unreported data sought directly from the investigators. Main results Excluding duplicate reports, we identified 14 trials (excluding one that was subsequently withdrawn from publication and not included in this analysis) including 2004 women that met the inclusion criteria. The limited data available were not suitable for meta-analysis because they all came from separate trials. Trials were small and generally of moderate quality. One trial of 45 women that compared injection therapy with conservative treatment showed early benefit for the injectable with respect to continence grade (risk ratio (RR) 0.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.94) and quality of life (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.92). Another, comparing Injection of autologous fat with placebo, terminated early because of safety concerns. Two trials that compared injection with surgical management found significantly better objective cure in the surgical group (RR 4.77, 95% CI 1.96 to 11.64; and RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.79), although the latter trial data did not reach statistical significance if an intention-to-treat analysis was used. Eight trials compared different agents and all results had wide confidence intervals. Silicone particles, calcium hydroxylapatite, ethylene vinyl alcohol, carbon spheres and dextranomer hyaluronic acid combination gave improvements which were not shown to be more or less efficacious than collagen. Dextranomer hyaluronic acid compound treated patients appeared to have significantly higher rates of injection site complications (16% with the hyaluronic acid compound versus none with collagen; RR 37.78, 95% CI 2.34 to 610) and this product has now been withdrawn from the market. A comparison of periurethral and transurethral methods of injection found similar outcomes but a higher (though not statistically significant) rate of early complications in the periurethral group. One trial of 30 women showed a weak (but not clinically significant) advantage for patient satisfaction (data not suitable for analysis in Revman) after mid-urethral injection in comparison to bladder neck injection but with no demonstrable difference in continence levels. Authors' conclusions The available evidence base remains insufficient to guide practice. In addition, the finding that placebo saline injection was followed by a similar symptomatic improvement to bulking agent injection raises questions about the mechanism of any beneficial effects. One small trial comparing silicone particles with pelvic floor muscle training was suggestive of benefit at three months but it is not known if this was sustained, and the treatment was associated with high levels of postoperative retention and dysuria. Greater symptomatic improvement was observed with surgical treatments, though the advantages need to be set against likely higher risks. No clear-cut conclusions could be drawn from trials comparing alternative agents, although dextranomer hyaluronic acid was associated with more local side effects and is no longer commercially available for this indication. There is insufficient evidence to show superiority of mid-urethral or bladder neck injection. The single trial of autologous fat provides a reminder that periurethral injections can occasionally cause serious side effects.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1469-493X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2012,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CD003881","10.1002/14651858.CD003881.pub3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000301187200027",22336797,8,"8 no 10"

Although the term ""regenerative medicine"" has been applied to encompass most fields of medicine, in fact urology has been one of the most progressive. Many urological applications have been investigated over the past decades, with the culmination of these technologies in the introduction of the first laboratory-produced organ to be placed in a human body. 1 With the quality of life issues associated with urinary incontinence, there is a strong driver to identify and introduce new technologies and the potential exists for further major advancements from regenerative medicine approaches using biomaterials, cells or a combination of both. A central question is why use biomaterials? The answer rests on the need to make up for inadequate or lack of autologous tissue, to decrease morbidity and to improve long-term efficacy. Thus, the ideal biomaterial needs to meet the following criteria: (1) Provide mechanical and structural support, (2) Maintain compliance and be biocompatible with surrounding tissues, and (3) Be ""fit for purpose"" by meeting specific application needs ranging from static support to bioactive cell signaling. In essence, this represents a wide range of biomaterials with a spectrum of potential applications, from use as a supportive or bulking implant alone, to implanted biomaterials that promote integration and eventual replacement by infiltrating host cells, or scaffolds pre-seeded with cells prior to implant. In this review we shall discuss the structural versus the integrative uses of biomaterials by referring to two key areas in urology of (1) pelvic organ support for prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, and (2) bladder replacement/augmentation.

Although medical treatment gives some rather deceiving results, surgical techniques that include colposuspension or tension-free vaginal tape, employed in cases of urethral support defect, give a 5-year cure rate of more than 80%. However, these techniques could lead to complications or recurrence of symptoms. Recently, the initiation of urethral cell therapy has been undertaken by doctors and researchers. One principal source of autologous adult stem cells is generally used: muscle precursor cells (MPCs) which are the progenitors of skeletal muscle cells. Recently, a few research groups have shown interest in the MPCs and their potential for the treatment of urinary incontinence. However, using MPCs or fibroblasts isolated from a striated muscle biopsy could be questionable on several points. One of them is the in vitro cultivation of cells, which raises issues over the potential cost of the technique. Besides, numerous studies have shown the multipotent or even the pluripotent nature of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) or adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) from adipose tissue. These cells are capable of acquiring in vitro many different phenotypes. Furthermore, recent animal studies have highlighted the potential interest of SVF cells or ASCs in cell therapy, in particular for mesodermal tissue repair and revascularization. Moreover, the potential interest of SVF cells or ASCs for the treatment of urinary incontinence in women is supported by many other characteristics of these cells that are discussed here. Because access to these cells via lipoaspiration is simple, and because they are found in very large numbers in adipose tissue, their future potential as a stem cell reservoir for use in urethral or other types of cell therapy is enormous.",NA,NA,NA,"FRITEL, Xavier/K-8566-2012","FRITEL, Xavier/0000-0002-4987-8127",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1582-1838",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JAN-FEB",2010,"14","02-Jan",NA,NA,NA,NA,"135","142",NA,"10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00915.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000275639700011",19799652,8,"8 no 24"

Methods: Articles from peer-reviewed journals, abstracts from scientific meetings, and literature searches by hand and electronically formed the basis of this review. The articles were evaluated using Levels of Evidences adapted by the ICUD from the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine. The Recommendations for Care were based on the level of evidence and discussed among the committee members to reach consensus. The incontinence problems were classified according to their etiology, that is, either primarily sphincter or bladder related. Results: Specialist evaluation of the patient is primarily a clinical approach with history, frequency-volume chart, physical examination, and post-void residual urine. Other investigations such as radiographic imaging of the lower urinary tract, cystoscopy, and urodynamic studies can provide important information for the clinician. For stress incontinence of various etiologies the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) has the longest record of satisfactory results. Consideration must be given to the need for revisions for mechanical breakdown, erosion/infection, and recurrent incontinence, as well as cost. Sling procedures are increasingly being reported to have good outcomes for mild to moderate incontinence. Injectable agents have not shown durable results but newer technologies such as volume-adjustable balloons have shown favorable early results. Incontinence following cystectomy with neobladder and pelvic trauma has been treated most commonly with the AUS. Conclusions: Although the literature is replete with well-done cohort studies, there is a need for prospective randomized clinical trials. Recommendations for trials include standardized workup and outcome measures and complete reporting of adverse events and long-term results. Further research is also needed to elucidate the mechanism of post-prostatectomy incontinence. Neurourol. Urodynam. 29:179-190, 2010.

Instead scientists have explored other cell sources, including progenitor and stem cells derived from adult tissues and stem cells derived from the amniotic fluid and placenta. In addition, novel techniques for generating stem cells in the laboratory are being developed. These techniques include somatic cell nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus of an adult somatic cell is placed into an oocyte, and reprogramming of adult cells to induce stem-cell-like behavior.

The latter have shown an overlap with suicides, but also with fatal accidental intoxications. The objective was to analyze potential differences and similarities in the patterns of risk factors for accidental intoxications, injuries/intoxications with undetermined intent, and suicides, respectively. Methods: A follow-up register study was conducted, using data from ASI interviews with clients in the criminal justice system in Sweden (n=6744), followed in the National Causes of Death Register. A set of risk factors from the ASI interview were tested in bivariate analysis with the respective cause of death, yielding significant risk factors further analyzed in three Cox regression models. Results: In Cox regression analyses, death from fatal accidental intoxication was associated with male gender (HR 4.09), use of heroin (HR 2.86), and use of cannabis (HR 1.94), and death from intoxication/injury of undetermined intent was associated with use of heroin (HR 3.48), binge drinking of alcohol (HR 2.46) and previous psychiatric hospitalization (HR 2.41), while negatively associated with depression (HR 0.33). Death from suicide was associated with previous suicide attempts (HR 2.78) and use of sedatives (HR 2.17). Conclusions: In this population of criminal justice clients with reported substance use problems, fatal injuries/intoxications with undetermined intent - like fatal accidental intoxications - appear to be associated with substance use variables, and cannot readily be assumed to represent the same background factors as suicide.

Polydrug abuse is associated with increased toxicity and poorer treatment outcome; thus, a better understanding of the consequences of repeated coadministration of these drugs will facilitate the development of better prevention and treatment strategies. This study examined the effects of daily treatment with the cannabinoid receptor agonist delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ((9)-THC) and its discontinuation on self-administration of heroin in rhesus monkeys (n=4) lever-pressing under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule. Heroin self-administration (0.32-32g/kg/infusion, intravenously) generated an inverted U-shaped dose-effect curve. Administered acutely, (9)-THC (0.01-0.32mg/kg, subcutaneously) dose dependently decreased responding for heroin and flattened the self-administration dose-effect curve. Daily treatment with (9)-THC (0.01-0.1mg/kg/12h, subcutaneously) either had no effect on or decreased responding for heroin. In addition, daily treatment did not significantly impact extinction of heroin self-administration or resumption of responding for heroin after extinction. Discontinuation of daily (9)-THC treatment did not systematically impact rates of heroin self-administration. These data suggest that repeated administration of a cannabinoid receptor agonist likely does not increase, and possibly decreases, the positive reinforcing effects of a mu opioid receptor agonist.

Interventions to prevent overdose risk behaviors among high-risk patients are lacking.

Methods: This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial set in a single emergency department (ED) in which, 204 adult, English-speaking patients seeking care who reported prescription opioid misuse during the prior 3 months were recruited. Patients were randomized to either the intervention, a 30-minute motivational interviewing-based session delivered by a therapist plus educational enhanced usual care (EUC), or EUC alone. Participants completed self-reported surveys at baseline and 6 months post-baseline (87% retention rate) to measure the primary outcomes of overdose risk behaviors and the secondary outcome of non-medical opioid use. Findings: Participants in the intervention condition reported significantly lower levels of overdose risk behaviors (incidence rate ratio [IRA] = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59-0.87; 40.5% reduction in mean vs. 14.7%) and lower levels of non-medical opioid use (IRR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.92; 50.0% reduction in mean vs. 39.5%) at follow-up compared to the EUC condition.

All veterans who died from a drug overdose (n=2400) while receiving opioid analgesics and a random sample of veterans (n=420 386) who received VHA medical services and opioid analgesics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Death from drug overdose, defined as any intentional, unintentional, or indeterminate death from poisoning caused by any drug, determined by information on cause of death from the National Death Index. RESULTS During the study period 27% (n=112 069) of veterans who received opioid analgesics also received benzodiazepines. About half of the deaths from drug overdose (n=1185) occurred when veterans were concurrently prescribed benzodiazepines and opioids. Risk of death from drug overdose increased with history of benzodiazepine prescription: adjusted hazard ratios were 2.33 (95% confidence interval 2.05 to 2.64) for former prescriptions versus no prescription and 3.86 (3.49 to 4.26) for current prescriptions versus no prescription. Risk of death from drug overdose increased as daily benzodiazepine dose increased.

It is a narcotic analgesic proposed for relief of pain (moderate to severe, or chronic pain). Although first developed in 1916, oxycodone is available on the French market only since 2000, in immediate release (OxyNorm (R) and OxyNormOro (R), as capsule or injectable form and oral liquid, respectively) and controlled release (OxyContin (R), as tablet). The delivery of oxycodone follows the rules of drugs of abuse (special medical prescription, prescription for no more than 28 days). Numerous fatal overdoses have been described in the US, but are very seldom in France as recreational use remains rare. We describe here 3 fatalities (2 women and 1 man) involving oxycodone, including analytical procedures and interpretation that occurred in 3 different cities of France. A general screening, involving immunochemistry and gas-liquid chromatography identified in each case oxycodone and some other pharmaceuticals. Neither ethanol nor drugs of abuse were detected. Oxycodone was tested by LC-MS/MS in the 3 cases. The following results were obtained in peripheral blood: case 1, oxycodone (2344 ng/mL) + alprazolam (112 ng/mL) + sertraline (1323 ng/mL); case 2, oxycodone (600 ng/mL) + zopiclone (1000 ng/mL) + mianserine (580 ng/mL) + citalopram (150 ng/mL); case 3, oxycodone (1400 ng/mL) + zopiclone (1850 ng/mL) + nordiazepam (395 ng/mL) + oxazepam (45 ng/mL). Due to the toxicological findings, all 3 deaths were listed as acute oxycodone intoxication in a polydrug abuse situation. The discussion will be focused on the comparison of our results with the existing literature, the absence of drug abuse and the original circumstances of death.

The reported number of physicians' patients taking opioids was positively associated with their confidence and comfort levels in opioid prescribing and negatively associated with their belief that many patients become addicted to opioids. Conclusion Most physicians have encountered opioid-related adverse events.

Prescribing opioids for chronic noncancer pain has recently escalated in the United States. Contrasting with increasing opioid use are: 1) The lack of evidence supporting long-term effectiveness; 2) Escalating misuse of prescription opioids including abuse and diversion; and 3) Uncertainty about the incidence and clinical salience of multiple, poorly characterized adverse drug events (ADEs) including endocrine dysfunction, immunosuppression and infectious disease, opioid-induced hyperalgesia and xerostomia, overdose, falls and fractures, and psychosocial complications. Chief among the limitations of current evidence are: 1) Sparse evidence on long-term opioid effectiveness in chronic pain patients due to the short-term time frame of clinical trials; 2) Insufficiently comprehensive outcome assessment; and 3) Incomplete identification and quantification of ADEs. The panel called for a strategic interdisciplinary approach to the problem domain in which basic scientists and clinicians cooperate to resolve urgent issues and generate a comprehensive evidence base. It offered 4 recommendations in 3 areas: 1) A research strategy for studying the effectiveness of long-term opioid pharmacotherapy; 2) Improvements in evidence-generation methodology; and 3) Potential research topics for generating new evidence. Perspective: Prescribing opioids for CNCP has outpaced the growth of scientific evidence bearing on the benefits and harms of these interventions. The need for a strong evidence base is urgent. This guideline offers a strategic approach to creating a comprehensive evidence base to guide safe and effective management of CNCP.

A structured review resulted in 15 articles (describing 14 unique studies) published between 1990 and 2010 that examined both overdose and suicide in samples of substance users. There is some evidence that substance users who attempt suicide are more likely to report an overdose and vice versa. This relationship may be partially explained by the fact that overdose is a common method of suicide. The results of the literature review also indicate that substance users with a history of both events may represent a group with particularly poor psychological and social functioning and severe drug-related problems. Further research is needed to understand the overlap of, and differences between, suicide and accidental overdose among individuals who misuse substances, particularly individuals who primarily use substances other than heroin.

Method: A self-administered, cross-sectional Web survey was conducted in 2005 at a large public Midwestern 4-year university in the U.S. using a probability-based sampling approach. The final sample included 4580 full-time undergraduate students. Results: The three most common motives associated with the nonmedical use of prescription opioids were to relieve pain, get high, and experiment. The leading sources of prescription opioids were friends and parents although there were gender differences in reports of primary sources. More than I in every 10 nonmedical users reported intranasal administration. Multivariate analyses indicated nonmedical users of prescription opioids who used for motives other than to relieve pain, obtained these drugs from non-parental sources, or used these drugs via non-oral routes of administration were significantly more likely to experience substance use related problems. Conclusions: These results indicate that nonmedical use of prescription opioids represents a considerable problem for particular subgroups of college students.

We used mouse eyes which wore CL as the animal model to assess the reason for corneal NV with CL wear. The similar and overlapping activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the potent angiogenic hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha(HIF-1 alpha) called for a study of the temporal relationship in the expression of these two autocoids. We determined the time dependent expression of HIF-1 alpha and correlated it to that of VEGF expression in the mouse model of closed eye with CL wear. Methods: Mouse eyes were fitted with CL followed by a silk suture tarsorrhaphy. The anterior surface was analyzed at 4, 7, and 10 days after tarsorrhaphy by slit lamp and corneal NV. HIF-1 alpha and VEGF levels were measured by reverse transcription PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence with specific primers and antibodies. We used shRNA targeting HIF-1 alpha to substantiate the link between HIF-1 alpha, VEGF expression, and angiogenesis in the CL wear model. Results: Corneal NV scores increased in a time dependent manner in the model of closed eye CL induced hypoxic injury. Corneal epithelial HIF-1 alpha and VEGF expression increased in a time dependent manner. The prolonged hypoxic state brought by closed eye CL wear induced a time dependent neovascular response which was significantly attenuated by HIF-1 alpha specific shRNA but not by nonspecific shRNA. Both HIF-1 alpha and VEGF levels were reduced significantly in corneal homogenates from eyes treated with the HIF-1 alpha specific shRNA. Conclusions: The present study documented the increased expression of HIF-1 alpha in the corneal epithelium during CL wear. It also demonstrated the presence of VEGF in the corneal epithelium and its increased expression in this model. Altogether, the results of this study raised the possibility of interaction between HIF-1 alpha and VEGF, in mediating the neovascularization response induced by the prolonged hypoxic state brought about by closed eye CL wear.

The carriers successfully pursued in pre-clinical (animal) models will be presented so as to provide a glimpse of possible candidates for clinical testing. Supramolecular assembly of nucleic acids with carriers will be probed from thermodynamics and computational perspectives to understand supramolecular structures and their dynamics. The delivery and trafficking requirements for siRNA are then dissected and engineering approaches to overcoming these barriers will be articulated. The latter has been attempted both at the cellular levels, focusing on intracellular barriers, as well as systemic level, emphasizing macroscopic challenges affecting siRNA delivery. Clinical experience with non-viral siRNA delivery is summarized, highlighting the nature delivery modes attempted in clinical settings. We conclude with a perspective on the future of siRNA therapeutics, specifically concentrating on the possible impact of non-viral carriers in the field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between annexin A2 (ANXA2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CNV. Methods In a rat model of argon laser coagulation-induced CNV, the mRNA expressions of the annexins and VEGF protein expression in the retina were detected using fluorescent real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The interactions between ANXA2 and VEGF in both a retinal pigment epithelial cell line RPE-J and the rat model of CNV were examined by means of RNA interference, real-time PCR, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and histopathological examinations. Results Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed that argon laser coagulation of the retina induced stable CNV models in the rats. Two to three weeks after the coagulation, ANXA2 and VEGF expressions in the coagulated area in the retina and choroid increased to the peak level, while the other annexin members (ANXA4, ANXA5, ANXA7 and ANXA11) showed no obvious changes. In RPE-J cells and the CNV model, RNA interference of ANXA2 gene significantly lowered the VEGF protein and mRNA expressions, and application of an adenoviral vector containing ANXA2 gene markedly increased VEGF expressions in the rat model of CNV, but produced no significant effects on the expressions of the kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) or the fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt-1). The expression of KDR inhibited the increment in ANXA2 expression, but VEGF and Flt-1 did not directly affect ANXA2 expression. Conclusion Besides the role as a plasminogen and the receptor of tissue plasminogen activator, ANXA2, which is under regulation of KDR via a negative feedback mechanism, also participates in neovascularization by regulating VEGF expression through a positive feedback mechanism.

Its SRA domain recognizes hemi-methylated DNA that appears in daughter DNA strands during duplication of DNA. UHRF1 recruits DNMT1 to the site and methylates both strands. UHRF1 also binds to HDAC1 and di- and tri-methyl K9 histone H3, ubiquitinates histone H3, and associates with heterochromatin formation, indicating that UHRF1 links histone modifications, DNA methylation, and chromatin structure. UHRF1 is a direct target of E2F1 and promotes G1/S transition. The tumor suppressor p53, which is deficient in 50% of cancers, down-regulates UHRF1 through up-regulation of p21/WAF1 and subsequent deactivation of E2F1. The expression levels of UHRF1 are up-regulated in many cancers, probably partially because of the absence of wild type p53, but it is probably regulated by several other factors. Knockdown of UHRF1 expression in cancer cells suppressed cell growth, suggesting that UHRF1 can be a useful anticancer drug target. Recently, it was revealed that UHRF1 plays important roles not only in carcinogenesis, but also in toxoplasmosis, which is occasionally fatal to people with a weakened immune system, and can cause blindness in the major pathology of ocular toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis, utilizes UHRF1 to control the cell cycle phase and enhance its proliferation. Thus, knockdown of UHRF1 can be effective at stopping the proliferation of the parasites in infected cells. In this review, we discuss several possible methods that can inhibit the multiple unique functions of UHRF1, which can be utilized for treating cancers and toxoplasmosis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 plays a central physiological role in oxygen and energy homeostasis and is activated during hypoxia by stabilization of the subunit HIF-1 alpha. Hypoxia plays an important role in the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Expression of HIF-1 alpha has been demonstrated in CNV. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most well-characterized angiogenic factors in CNV, which is under the regulation of HIF-1. The aim of the present study was to explore the upstream signaling pathways involved in regulating hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1 alpha and VEGF in laser-induced rat CNV. METHODS. A well-established rat model of CNV and cultured human retinal pigment epithelium (hRPE) was used to investigate the role of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways in regulating HIF-1 alpha and VEGF expression in CNV in rat and hRPE under hypoxia by immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, realtime PCR, and ELISA. RESULTS. pAkt, pERK, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF were upregulated in vivo and in vitro. PI3K inhibitor (Ly294002) significantly decreased pAkt activity and HIF-1 alpha and VEGF expression in vivo and in vitro, whereas MEK inhibitor (PD98059) reduced ERK phosphorylation and the expression of VEGF but had no effect on HIF-1 alpha. LY294002 and PD98059 severely inhibited the formation of CNV. CONCLUSIONS. The PI3K/Akt pathway was required for hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1 alpha and VEGF, whereas the MEK/ERK pathway was required only for VEGF in laser-induced rat CNV.

METHODS: A ribozyme (Rz397) was designed to hybridize with an accessible region in rhodopsin mRNA. It was tested in vitro to determine the kinetics of cleavage of a target oligonucleotide. Following transfection of cultured cells, reduction of rhodopsin mRNA in response to Rz397 was measured RT-PCR. The gene for the ribozyme (Rz397) was inserted in an adeno-associated virus (AAV2) vector and packaged in AAV2 capsids. The virus was injected subretinally in the eyes of C57BL/6J (RHO+/+) and rhodopsin knockout hemizygous (RHO+/-) mice at postnatal days 6 (P6) and 30 (P30). Mice were analyzed by full-field electroretinography (ERG). The reduction of opsin protein was measured by western blot analysis and visualized by immunocytochemistry. Reduction of rhodopsin mRNA was assessed using in situ hybridization. Morphometric microscopy of fluorescent antibody-antigen complexes and autoradiography of retinas were used to quantify levels of rhodopsin protein and mRNA, respectively. RESULTS: Transient co-transfection of HEK 293 cells with a wild-type rhodopsin cDNA and Rz397 resulted in an approximately 60% reduction of RHO mRNA one day after transfection. RHO+/--mice injected with AAV2-Rz397 at P6 showed a 50% reduction in b-wave amplitudes in injected eyes relative to saline injected contralateral eyes. However, injection of RHO+/--animals at one month and of RHO+/+-animals at either age had no impact on ERG. Nevertheless, we detected an 80% reduction of opsin protein in ribozyme-injected eyes of hemizygous mice (by western blot) and a 50% reduction in opsin content in RHO+/+ mice (by morphometry). These reductions were confirmed by in situ hybridization. CONCLUSIONS: AAV2-Rz397 led to significant (greater than or equal to 50%) reduction of rhodopsin mRNA and protein in mice.

The transcription profile of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules in the sieve tubes is unique and does not reflect the transcript profile in the neighboring companion cells. This discovery suggests tight regulation on cell-to-cell movement of mRNA molecules from the companion cells into the sieve tube. Heterografting experiments and RNA-detection methods have provided unequivocal evidence for the trafficking of several specific mRNA molecules between distant organs. Detection of various plant transcripts in their respective plant parasites further confirms this long-distance movement. The finding that several of these trafficked transcripts are involved in the control of developmental processes as well as responses to growth substances or environmental cues has led to a new paradigm that mRNA molecules act as non-cell-autonomous signaling agents operating in the vascular system. Trafficking of these molecules creates a communication network between distant organs that is required for coordinated development of the whole plant under adverse conditions. The generality of this concept, however, is still under debate, because the raison d'etre for long-distance movement of mRNA is not clear. In this review we discuss the identity and potential function of phloem-sap mRNA molecules, the factors facilitating RNA transport, and the rationale for their action as long-distance signaling agents in the control of developmental processes.

In this regard, quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has emerged as an essential technique in our efforts to characterize alterations in gene expression brought on by exposure to alcohol. However, many publications continue to report the utilization of inappropriate methods of qPCR normalization, and for many in vitro models, no consistent set of empirically tested normalization controls have been identified. In the present study, we sought to identify a group of candidate reference genes for use within studies of alcohol exposed embryonic, placental, and neurosphere stem cells under both conditions maintaining sternness as well as throughout in vitro differentiation. To this end, we surveyed the recent literature and compiled a short list of fourteen candidate genes commonly used as normalization controls in qPCR studies of gene expression. This list included: Actb, B2m, Gapdh, Gusb, H2afz, Hk2, Hmbs, Hprt, Mrpl1, Pgk1, Ppia, Sdha, Tbp, and Ywhaz. From these studies, we find no single candidate gene was consistently refractory to the influence of alcohol nor completely stable throughout in vitro differentiation. Accordingly, we propose normalizing qPCR measurements to the geometric mean C-T values obtained for three independent reference mRNAs as a reliable method to accurately interpret qPCR data and assess alterations in gene expression within alcohol treated cultures. Highlighting the importance of careful and empirical reference gene selection, the commonly used reference gene Actb was often amongst the least stable candidate genes tested. In fact, it would not serve as a valid normalization control in many cases. Data presented here will aid in the design of future experiments using stem cells to study the transcriptional processes driving differentiation, and model the developmental impact of teratogens.

However, evidence demonstrating the functional significance of non-cell autonomous RNA remains limited. Recent analyses of Arabidopsis and rice revealed FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein as a systemic florigenic signal. However, whether the FT RNA also participates in systemic floral regulation remains controversial. By using Arabidopsis cleft-grafting experiments, we showed that the RNA of Arabidopsis FT undergoes long-distance movement from the stock to the scion apex in both FT transformants and non-transformants. In addition, the sequences of FT RNA are sufficient to target a cell-autonomous RNA for long-distance movement. Therefore, FT RNA is a bona fide non-cell autonomous RNA. To examine the systemic action of FT RNA, we uncoupled the movement of FT RNA from protein by fusing FT with RED FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (RFP). When RFP-FT protein was retained in companion cells, the detection of RFP-FT RNA correlates with floral promotion in the scion. Further depletion of the translocated RFP-FT RNA by RNAi or artificial miRNA against FT delayed the floral promotion, indicating that the translocated FT RNA acts as a part of the systemic floral signaling.

It is thought that these RNA macromolecules are selectively delivered via plasmodesmata from companion cells to sieve tubes, which are devoid of nuclei. A number of these phloem-delivered RNAs were shown to have a regulatory function in differentiation and adaptation to environmental conditions.

Recent studies have provided evidence that the FT protein in Arabidopsis and corresponding proteins in other species are an important part of florigen. Our work shows that the FT activity, either from overexpressing or inducible transgenes or from the endogenous gene, to promote flowering is transmissible through a graft junction, and that an FT protein with a T7 tag is transported from a donor scion to the apical region of recipient stock plants and becomes detectable within a day or two.

Soluble CD8 suppression can also be seen in some older children with AIDS. The factor responsible, CD8-derived antiviral factor (CAF), acts at the level of HIV RNA transcription. Differential gene expression techniques have been used to define the gene(s) mediating this phenomenon in adults. Recently, CAF has been linked to exosomes secreted by CD8+ T-cells. To compare the gene expression profiles from pediatric patients with each other, with those reported in 2 previous studies in adults and in those reportedly related to exosomes, we used differential gene expression to study three older children with HIV infection, one who did demonstrate soluble CD-8 suppression and two who did not. Eighteen differentially expressed genes were also seen in one adult study (P = 0.002, chi(2) test), and 38 such genes (P < 0.0001, chi(2) test) in a second adult study. In addition, two exosome components and some RNA's related to exosomal proteins were also differentially expressed. In children with HIV infection, we found significant differentially expressed genes that correlated to those previously reported in two studies in adults.

In contrast, theta-defensins are cyclic anti-microbial peptides made by several non-human primates but not humans.

We studied the anti-HIV-1 activity of one defensin from each group, HNP-1 (alpha), HBD-2 (beta) and RTD-1 (theta). We examined how each defensin affected HIV-1 infection and demonstrated that the cyclic defensin RTD-1 inhibited HIV-1 entry, while acyclic HNP-1 and HBD-2 inhibited HIV-1 replication even when added 12 hours post-infection and blocked viral replication after HIV-1 cDNA formation. We further found that all three defensins downmodulated CXCR4. Moreover, RTD-1 inactivated X4 HIV-1, while HNP-1 and HBD-2 inactivated both X4 and R5 HIV-1.

The results showed a significantly increased production of alpha-defensins in plasma, neutrophils and CD8 T-lymphocytes of patients with HIV infection in comparison with healthy controls. The expression of alpha-defensins, by CD8+ cells probably reflects both the intrinsic production and the uptake from cocultured cells that release defensins. The upregulation of alpha-defensin expression within neutrophils could account for the increased release of such peptides in the systemic circulation.

The level of PMN death was significantly more severe in RMs that progressed more rapidly to AIDS and coincided with neutropenia. Neutropenia was also observed in Indian RMs and was higher in non-Mamu-A*01 compared with Mamu-A*01 animals. In stark contrast, no changes in the levels of PMN death were observed in the nonpathogenic model of SIVagm-sab (sabaeus) infection of AGMs despite similarly high viral replication. PMN death was a Bax and Bak-independent mitochondrial insult, which is prevented by inhibiting calpain activation but not caspases. We found that BOB/GPR15, a SIV coreceptor, is expressed on the PMN surface of RMs at a much higher levels than AGMs and its ligation induced PMN death, suggesting that SIV particle binding to the cell surface is sufficient to induce PMN death. Taken together, our results suggest that species-specific differences in BOB/GPR15 receptor expression on PMN can lead to increased acute phase PMN death.

In addition, soluble factors different from those related to specific immune responses appear to correlate with the establishment and maintenance of the protective status. Material/Methods: Investigated were: 1) the ability of CD8(+) T cells from cynomolgus monkeys vaccinated with SIV Delta-nef and long-term protected against sequential SIVs and SHIV challenges to inhibit in vitro SHIV replication in an acute infection cell system, 2) the ability of cell-free supernatants from CD8(+) T cell cultures to inhibit replication of HIV in chronically infected cells, and 3) whether the antiviral activity of CD8(+) T cells correlated with IFN gamma production. Results: Soluble factor(s) secreted by CD8(+) T cells from Delta-nef vaccinated monkeys significantly inhibited SHIV replication in an autologous cell system. This effect was not dependent on beta-chemokine secretion and correlated with an increased IFN gamma production. In addition, since supernatants from CD8(+) T cells inhibited HIV production in chronically infected monocytic cells, the suppressive activity was not related to the viral strain. Conclusions: Vaccination with the live attenuated virus induces both a CD8(+) T cell-dependent antiviral activity and IFN gamma responses potentially responsible for the protection from challenge with heterologous highly pathogenic SHIV89.6P.

Adenovirus (Ad), a major cause of viral conjunctivitis worldwide, is controlled initially by the innate immune response on the ocular surface. In the present study, cultured human conjunctival epithelial cells were used to identify host genes responsive to infection by a clinical isolate of Ad5, and the antiviral activity of some of their peptide products was investigated. METHODS. Primary human conjunctival epithelial cells in culture were infected with Ad5 at high (1.0), low (0.1), or zero (0.0) multiplicities of infection (MOI) and harvested at different times after infection (1.5, 6, and 16 hours). Host gene expression was profiled with oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChips; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Peptide products of interest were tested for antiviral activity in direct inhibition assays against respiratory serotypes (Ad3, Ad5), ocular serotypes (Ad8, Ad19), and HSV-1. RESULTS. At high MOI, viral infection suppressed the interferon (IFN)-mediated host antiviral response seen at low MOI. At 16 hours after infection, 63 unique characterized transcripts were identified that were robustly and significantly suppressed by high MOI, (i.e., MOI [0.1]/MOI [0.1] >= 2, P < 0.006). Of these, 29 ( 46%) transcripts are involved in IFN signaling or are IFN or virus induced. This subset included CXCL10 and CXCL11, encoding IP-10 and I-TAC, respectively. These defensin-like chemokines and human alpha-defensin-1 directly inhibited Ad3 and Ad5 but not Ad8 or Ad19. CONCLUSIONS. In response to low-level Ad5 infection, conjunctival epithelial cells showed upregulation of IFN-associated genes. The peptide products of two of these, IP-10 and I-TAC, are directly active against Ad3, and IP-10 is active against Ad5.

To address this problem, it is necessary to re-examine the practice of acupuncture using scientific methodology. The standardization of acupuncture practices may offer a solution. As a preliminary step towards the standardization of acupuncture stimulation in animal experiments, this study attempted to clarify the various therapeutic parameters that contribute to acupuncture's efficacy. Methods: This study identified specific acupoints, temporal point of needling, rotation of the needle, duration of acupuncture, and diameter of the needle as the parameters, through formalin test. In this test, acupuncture was performed on either the ST36 or LR2 point immediately after pain induction and 5 minutes after pain induction. Results: The formalin test yielded no significant suppression of pain in the case of ST36 and LR2 acupuncture stimulation immediately following pain induction. When acupuncture was applied 5 minutes after pain induction, however, the ST36 stimulation resulted in a significant decrease in pain, while the LR2 stimulation produced no change. The duration of acupuncture, but not the diameter of the needle, was also significant. As for the rotation of the needle, there was no significant difference in the pain reduction achieved in the rotation and non-rotation groups.

Whether acupuncture needling at a peripheral acupoint produces distinct patterns of brain responses remains controversial. Results: This fMRI study employed the complex network analysis (CNA) to test the hypothesis that acupuncture stimulation at an acupoint correspondingly induced activity changes in one or more intrinsic or resting-state brain networks. Built upon the sustained effect of acupuncture and its time-varying characteristics, we constructed a dynamic encoding system with the hub anchored at the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/pC). We found that needling at two visual acupoints (GB37 and BL60) and a non-visual acupoint (KI8) induced a spatially converging brain response, which overlapped at the PCC/pC. We also found distinct neural modulations during and after acupoint stimulation. During this period, the PCC/pC interacted with a visual resting-state network in different patterns. Furthermore, there was a delayed functional correspondence between the intrinsic visual network and manipulation over the visual acupoints (i.e., GB37 or BL60), but not the non-visual acupoint (KI8) via the PCC/pC, implicating a specific temporal-spatial encoding/decoding mechanism underlying the post-effect of acupuncture.

The data acquisition was performed at resting state, during needle retention, electroacupuncture (EA) and post-EA resting state. Needling sensations were rated after every electroacupuncture (EA) procedure. The needling sensations and the brain functional activity and connectivity were compared between CV4 and CV12 using SPSS. SPM2 and the local and remote connectivity maps. Results and conclusion: EA at CV4 and CV12 induced apparent deactivation effects in the limbic-paralimbic-neocortical network. The default mode of the brain was modified by needle retention and EA, respectively. The functional brain network was significantly changed post EA. However, the minor differences existed between these two acupoints.

However, the neural substrates of acupuncture actions are not completely clear to date. FMRI studies at Hegu (L14) and Zusanli (ST36) indicated that the limbic system may play an important role for acupuncture effects. To test if this finding applies to other major classical acupoints, fMRI was performed on 10 healthy adults during manual acupuncture at Taichong (LV3), Xingjian (LV2), Neiting (ST44), and a sham point on the dorsum of the left foot. Although certain differences could be observed between real and sham points, the hemodynamic response (BOLD signal changes) and psychophysical response (sensory experience) to acupuncture were generally similar for all four points. Acupuncture produced extensive deactivation of the limbic-paralimbic-neocortical System. Clusters of deactivated regions were seen in the medial prefrontal cortex (frontal pole, pregenual cingulate), the temporal lobe (amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampus) and the posterior medial cortex (precuneus, posterior cingulate). The sensorimotor cortices (somatosensory cortices, supplementary motor cortex), thalamus and occasional paralimbic structures Such as the insula and anterior middle cingulate cortex showed activation. Our results provide additional evidence in support of previous reports that acupuncture modulates the limbic-paralimbic-neocortical network. We hypothesize that acupuncture may mediate its antipain, antianxiety, and other therapeutic effects via this intrinsic neural circuit that plays a central role in the affective and cognitive dimensions of pain as well as in the regulation and integration of emotion, memory processing, autonomic, endocrine, immunological, and sensorimotor functions.

In this study, we used a multiple-session experiment to test whether electroacupuncture stimulation at two TCM vision-related acupoints, UB 60 and GB 37, located on the leg, could produce fMRI signal changes in the occipital regions of the brain, and the specificity of this effect when compared with stimulation at an adjacent non-acupoint (NAP). Six normal, acupuncture naive subjects completed the study. Each subject participated in six identical scanning sessions. Voxelwise group analysis showed that electroacupuncture stimulation at both vision-related acupoints and the NAP produced modest, comparable fMRI signal decreases in the occipital cortex, including the bilateral cuneus, calcarine fissure and surrounding areas, lingual gyrus, and lateral occipital gyrus. Further analysis of fMRI signal changes in occipital cortex showed no significant difference among the three points, UB 60, GB 37, and NAP. Our results thus do not support the view that acupuncture Stimulation at vision-related acupoints induces specific fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the occipital cortex. We speculate that cross modal inhibition, produced by needling-evoked somatosensory stimulation, may account for our finding of BOLD signal decreases in the occipital cortex.

However, little clinical data are available regarding the relationship between miRNA expression patterns and breast cancer chemoresistance. Methods: We created a doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-/Adr) cell line using a pulse-selection method; then verified the resistance of the MCF-7/Adr cell line to doxorubicin by using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and Intracellular doxorubicin accumulation assay. Then, we performed qRT-PCR to detect the expression patterns of 14 selected miRNAs (which are related to breast cancer resistance) in both cell lines. Subsequently, we performed a bioinformatics analysis, including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, to determine the putative functions of 13 differentially expressed miRNA-targeted genes. Finally, we tested the expression levels of these 13 miRNAs in 10 chemotherapy non-responder breast cancer tissues and 29 responder tissues. All statistical analyses were performed by a two-tailed Student's t-test, and a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The results of the MTT assay showed that the MCF-7/Adr cell line was significantly more resistant to doxorubicin compared to the MCF-7 cells The results of the TUNEL assay indicated that doxorubicin induced an increase in the number apoptotic cells in the MCF-7 group. Additionally, the accumulation of doxorubicin was higher in MCF-7 cells compared to MCF-7/Adr cells, which was consistent with the MTT and TUNEL results. The qRT-PCR results demonstrated that compared to the parental MCF-7 cell line, miR-200a, miR-141, miR-200c, miR-31, miR-429, and miR-196b were over-expressed, and let-7e, miR-576-3p, miR-125b-1, miR-370, miR-145, miR-765, and miR-760 were significantly down-regulated in MCF-7/Adr cells. The GO analysis results revealed that the predicted target genes of these 14 miRNAs primarily regulated protein binding, zinc ion binding, DNA binding, and transcription factor activity. The KEGG data demonstrated that these target genes are mainly involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and other signaling pathways. Compared to the breast cancer tissues from chemotherapy responders, 10 miRNAs were identified to be dysregulated in the chemoresistant breast cancer tissues. Three of these miRNAs were up-regulated (miR-141, miR-200c, and miR-31), and 7 were down-regulated (let-7e, miR-576-3p, miR-125b-1, miR-370, miR-145, miR-765, and miR-760). Conclusion: In this study, we identified 10 dysregulated miRNAs in both breast cancer cells and chemoresistant tissues, which might be biomarkers for the prognosis of breast cancer chemoresistance. Our study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of prognostic biomarkers during clinical treatment, and we hypothesize that the miRNA signatures of drug-resistant carcinoma tissues could be useful for developing new strategies for targeted therapies in patients with chemoresistant breast cancer.

In the field of molecular-targeted therapy for cancer, in particular, the application of array-based methodologies has enabled the identification of molecular targets with 'key' roles in neoplastic transformation or tumor progression and the subsequent development of targeted agents, which are most likely to be active in the specific molecular setting. Herein, we present a summary of the main applications of whole-genome expression microarrays in the field of molecular-targeted therapies for solid tumors and we discuss their potential in the clinical setting.

We sought to develop pharmacogenomic predictors of Tax- and Ixa-response from a large panel of human breast tumor cell lines (BTCL), then to evaluate their performance in clinical samples. Thirty-two BTCL, representative of the molecular diversity of breast cancers (BC), were treated in vitro with Tax (paclitaxel (Pac), docetaxel (Doc)), and ixabepilone (Ixa), then classified as drug-sensitive or resistant according to their 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s). Baseline gene expression data were obtained using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 human oligonucleotide microarrays. Gene expression set (GES) predictors of response to taxanes were derived, then tested for validation internally and in publicly available gene expression datasets. In vitro IC50s of Pac and Doc were almost identical, whereas some Tax-resistant BTCL retained sensitivity to Ixa. GES predictors for Tax-sensitivity (333 genes) and Ixa-sensitivity (79 genes) were defined. They displayed a limited number of overlapping genes. Both were validated by leave-n-out cross-validation (n = 4; for overall accuracy (OA), P = 0.028 for Tax, and P = 0.0005 for Ixa).

Applying Tax and Ixa-GES to a dataset of clinically annotated early BC patients identified subsets of tumors with potentially distinct phenotypes of drug sensitivity: predicted Ixa-sensitive/Tax-resistant BC were significantly (P < 0.05, Fischer's exact test) more frequently ER/PR-positive, Ki67-negative, and luminal subtype than predicted Ixa-resistant/Tax-sensitive BC.

Methods: Parallel cell populations were initiated for two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and these were treated independently for 18 months with doxorubicin or paclitaxel. IC50 values against 4 chemotherapy agents were determined to measure cross-resistance. Chromosomal instability and karyotypic changes were determined by cytogenetics. TaqMan RT-PCR measurements were performed for resistance-candidate genes. Pgp activity was measured by FACS. Results: All together 16 doxorubicin-and 13 paclitaxel-treated cell lines were developed showing 2-46 fold and 3-28 fold increase in resistance, respectively. The RT-PCR and FACS analyses confirmed changes in tubulin isofom composition, TOP2A and MVP expression and activity of transport pumps (ABCB1, ABCG2). Cytogenetics showed less chromosomes but more structural aberrations in the resistant cells.

The objective of this study is the analysis of oncogenic pathways in ovarian cancer and their relation with clinical outcome. Methodology: A meta-analysis of 6 gene expression datasets was done for oncogenic pathway activation scores: AKT, beta-Catenin, BRCA, E2F1, EGFR, ER, HER2, INF alpha, INF gamma, MYC, p53, p63, PI3K, PR, RAS, SRC, STAT3, TNF alpha, and TGF beta and VEGF-A. Advanced serous papillary tumours from uniformly treated patients were selected (N = 464) to find differences independent from stage-, histology- and treatment biases. Survival and correlations with documented prognostic signatures (wound healing response signature WHR/genomic grade index GGI/invasiveness gene signature IGS) were analysed. Results: The GGI, WHR, IGS score were unexpectedly increased in chemosensitive versus chemoresistant patients. PR and RAS activation score were associated with survival outcome (p = 0.002; p = 0.004). Increased activations of beta-Catenin (p = 0.0009), E2F1 (p = 0.005), PI3K (p = 0.003) and p63 (p = 0.05) were associated with more favourable clinical outcome and were consistently correlated with three prognostic gene signatures. Conclusions: Oncogenic pathway profiling of advanced serous ovarian tumours revealed that increased beta-Catenin, E2F1, p63, PI3K, PR and RAS -pathway activation scores were significantly associated with favourable clinical outcome. WHR, GGI and IGS scores were unexpectedly increased in chemosensitive tumours.

Genetic defects in NER cause human hereditary diseases including xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), trichothiodystrophy and a combined XP/CS overlapping symptom. One key gene product associated with all these disorders is the excision repair cross-complementing 3/xeroderma pigmentosum B (ERCC3/XPB) DNA helicase, a subunit of the transcription factor IIH complex. ERCC3 is involved in initiation of basal transcription and global genome repair as well as in transcription-coupled repair (TCR).

We identified new mutations in the Chinese hamster ovary cell ERCC3 gene and characterized the role of hamster ERCC3 protein in DNA repair of ultraviolet (UV)-induced and oxidative DNA damage. All but one newly described mutations are located in the protein C-terminal region around the last intron-exon boundary. Due to protein truncations or frameshifts, they lack amino acid Ser751, phosphorylation of which prevents the 5' incision of the UV-induced lesion during NER. Thus, despite the various locations of the mutations, their phenotypes are similar. All ercc3 mutants are extremely sensitive to UV-C light and lack recovery of RNA synthesis (RRS), confirming a defect in TCR of UV-induced damage.

Although the detailed mechanism of TCR is not yet understood, it is believed to be triggered when a translocating RNA polymerase is arrested at a lesion or unusual structure in the DNA. Conventional assays for TCR require high doses of DNA damage for the statistical analysis of repair in the individual strands of DNA sequences ranging in size from a few hundred bases to 30 kb. The single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay allows detection of single- or double-strand breaks at a 10-100-fold higher level of resolution. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with the Comet assay (Comet-FISH) affords a heightened level of sensitivity for the assessment of repair in defined DNA sequences of cells treated with physiologically relevant doses of genotoxins. This approach also reveals localized susceptibility to chromosomal breakage in cells from individuals with hypersensitivity to radiation or chemotherapy. Several groups have reported preferential repair in transcriptionally active genes or chromosomal domains using Comet-FISH. The prevailing interpretation of the behavior of DNA in the Comet assay assumes that the DNA is arranged in loops and matrix-attachment sites; that supercoiled, undamaged loops are contained within the nuclear matrix and appear in Comet ""heads"", and that Comet ""tails"" consist of relaxed DNA loops containing one or more breaks. According to this model, localization of FISH probes in Comet heads signifies that loops containing the targeted sequences are free of damage. This implies that preferential repair as detected by Comet-FISH might encompass large chromosomal domains containing both transcribed and non-transcribed sequences. We review the existing evidence and discuss the implications in relation to current models for the molecular mechanism of TCR. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The trigger is thought to be the presence of an irreversibly blocked transcription complex, which is recognised by a transcription-repair coupling factor. Many common DNA lesions do not block transcription, but are bypassed with varying degrees of efficiency and with potentially mutagenic effects on the RNA transcripts that are produced. The effect of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, at such lesions is not known: it has been suggested that Mfd may promote mutagenesis by increasing the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses non-bulky lesions, but it has also been reported that 8-oxoguanine, a major product of oxidative DNA damage that is efficiently bypassed by RNA polymerase, is subject to Mfd-dependent transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli. We have investigated the effect of Mfd during transcription of templates containing 8-oxoguanine, and various other non-bulky lesions. We show that an 8-oxoguanine in the template strand induces a transient pause in transcription, and that Mfd neither increases nor decreases the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses the lesion. We also show that Mfd can displace a transcription complex stalled at a single strand nick, and that it decreases the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses an abasic site. These activities are not affected by transcription rate, as similar results were obtained using ""fast"" and ""slow"" mutant RNA polymerases. Our findings suggest that 8-oxoguanine is unlikely to be directly targeted by the transcription-coupled repair pathway, and identify a potential role for Mfd in reducing the level of transcriptional mutagenesis caused by abasic sites.

Besides a function in TCR of NER lesions, a role of CSB in (transcription-coupled) repair of oxidative DNA damage has been suggested. In this study we used mouse models to compare the effect of a CSA or a CSB defect on oxidative DNA damage sensitivity at the levels of the cell and the intact organism. In contrast to CSB-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), CSA(-/-) MEFs are not hypersensitive to gamma-ray or paraquat treatment. Similar results were obtained for keratinocytes. In contrast, both CSB-/- and CSA(-/-) embryonic stem cells show slight gamma-ray sensitivity. Finally, CSB-/- but not CSA(-/-) mice fed with food containing di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (causing elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage in the liver) show weight reduction. These findings not only uncover a clear difference in oxidative DNA damage sensitivity between CSA- and CSB-deficient cell lines and mice but also show that sensitivity to oxidative DNA damage is not a uniform characteristic of Cockayne syndrome.

Methodology: We tested possible genetic interactions between GA-, ABA-, and BR-dependent pathways in the control of the transition to flowering. For this, single and double mutants deficient in the biosynthesis of GAs, ABA, and BRs were used to assess the effect of hormone deficiency on the timing of floral transition. Also, plants that over-express genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes in each biosynthetic pathway were generated and the flowering time of these lines was investigated. Conclusions: Loss-of-function studies revealed a complex relationship between GAs and ABA, and between ABA and BRs, and suggested a cross-regulatory relation between GAs to BRs. Gain-of-function studies revealed that GAs were clearly limiting in their sufficiency of action, whereas increases in BRs and ABA led to a more modest phenotypic effect on floral timing.

Accumulating evidence suggested that RACK1 may be involved in hormone responses, but the precise role of RACK1 in any hormone signalling pathway remains elusive. Molecular and genetic evidence that Arabidopsis RACK1 is a negative regulator of ABA responses is provided here. It is shown that three RACK1 genes act redundantly to regulate ABA responses in seed germination, cotyledon greening and root growth, because rack1a single and double mutants are hypersensitive to ABA in each of these processes. On the other hand, plants overexpressing RACK1A displayed ABA insensitivity. Consistent with their proposed roles in seed germination and early seedling development, all three RACK1 genes were expressed in imbibed, germinating and germinated seeds. It was found that the ABA-responsive marker genes, RD29B and RAB18, were up-regulated in rack1a mutants. Furthermore, the expression of all three RACK1 genes themselves was down-regulated by ABA. Consistent with the view that RACK1 negatively regulates ABA responses, rack1a mutants lose water significantly more slowly from the rosettes and are hypersensitive to high concentrations of NaCl during seed germination. In addition, the expression of some putative RACK1-interacting, ABA-, or abiotic stress-regulated genes was mis-regulated in rack1a rack1b double mutants in response to ABA.

In addition, we identified a putative miR-133a binding site in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of Fascin1 (FSCN1) gene using an online bioinformatical tool. We found that miR-133a transfection significantly reduced expression of FSCN1 mRNA and protein. The luciferase reporter assay confirmed that FSCN1 was the direct target gene of miR-133a. Conclusions: miR-133a expression was lost in breast cancer tissues, loss of which was associated with lymph nodes metastasis, high clinical stages and shorter relapse-free survivals of patients with breast cancer. Functionally, miR-133a can suppress tumor cell invasion and migration and targeted the expression of FSCN1.

We have developed a system to study the role of miRNAs in cell differentiation. We have found that one of the miRNAs tested in our system (miR-378, also called miR-378*) plays a role in modulating nephronectin-mediated differentiation in the osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1. Nephronectin is an extracellular matrix protein, and we have demonstrated that its over-expression enhanced osteoblast differentiation and bone nodule formation. Furthermore, we found that the nephronectin 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) contains a binding site for miR-378. Stable transfection of MC3T3-E1 cells with miR-378 inhibited cell differentiation. MC3T3-E1 cells stably transfected with nephronectin exhibited higher rates of differentiation and nodule formation as compared with cells transfected with nephronectin containing the 3'UTR in the early stages of development, suggesting that endogenous miR-378 is present and active. However, in the later stages of MC3T3-E1 development, the differentiation rates were opposite, with higher rates of differentiation and nodule formation in the cells over-expressing the 3'UTR of nephronectin. This appeared to be the consequence of competition between nephronectin and UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine: polypeptide N-acetylgalac-tosaminyltransferase 7 (GalNAc-T7 or GalNT7) for miR-378 binding, resulting in increased GalNT7 activity, which in turn lead to increased nephronectin glycosylation and product secretion, thereby resulting in a higher rate of osteoblast differentiation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203",NA,NA,NA,NA,"21-Oct",2009,"4","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"e7535","10.1371/journal.pone.0007535",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000271013000013",19844573,21,"21 no 8"

Based on mass-conservation principles and kinetic rate laws, we converted biochemical RNA interference pathways into a set of ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics of siRNA-mediated translation-regulation in mammalian cells. Capitalizing on mechanistic details of synthetic transactivator operation, we wired this model into a transcription control circuitry in which the siRNA and its target mRNA are independently regulated at the transcriptional level. In this context, we studied the impact of siRNA transcription timing on the onset of target gene transcription and production kinetics of target mRNA-encoded proteins. We also simulated the rate of siRNA-induced mRNA depletion and demonstrated that the relative concentrations of interacting siRNAs/mRNAs and the number of siRNA-specific target sites on a transcript modulate (i) the rate of target mRNA disappearance, (ii) the steady-state mRNA levels and (iii) induction dynamics of mRNA-encoded protein production.

Integration of siRNA-specific target sequences (TAGs) into the 5' or 3' untranslated regions (5'UTR, 3'UTR) of a desired constitutive transcription unit rendered transgene-encoded protein (erythropoietin, EPO; human placental alkaline phosphatase, SEAP; human vascular endothelial growth factor 121, VEGF(121)) production in mammalian cells responsive to siRNA levels that can be fine-tuned by macrolide-adjustable RNA polymerase II- or III-dependent promoters. Coupling of such macrolide-responsive siRNA-triggered translation control with tetracycline-responsive transcription of tagged transgene mRNAs created an antibiotic-adjustable two-input transcription-translation network characterized by elimination of detectable leaky expression with no reduction in maximum protein production levels. This transcription-translation network revealed transgene mRNA depletion to be dependent on siRNA and mRNA levels and that translation control was able to eliminate basal expression inherent to current transcription control modalities.

As P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the most studied ATP-dependent efflux pumps that are frequently involved in drug efflux from cancer cells, the development of MDR modulators with the ability to inhibit P-gp efflux is considered a promising approach for overcoming MDR. However, the development of P-gp modulators have been hampered due to the absence of knowledge on the intrinsic molecular aspects by which efflux occurs, namely the specific steps that correlates drug recognition, ATP binding and efflux-related conformational changes. Experimental evidences for these processes are also difficult to obtain and only provide small pieces of information that need to be assembled for better comprehension of a wider and complex process that is drug efflux. A promising alternative relies on cutting-edge computational techniques to provide new insights on key aspects that are determinant to understand how P-gp efflux can be effectively reversed. With the contribution of ligand-based or structure-based computational methods, P-gp drug efflux is slowly becoming a dynamic and reactive process rather than a simple response to drug binding, with the complex architecture of ABC transporters playing a determinant role not only in drug recognition but in the coordination of ATP-driven conformational changes that ultimately drives drug efflux.

Obtaining a residue alignment between compared structures is often a prerequisite for such comparative analysis. If the conformational change of the protein is dramatic, conventional alignment methods may struggle to provide an intuitive solution for straightforward analysis. To make such analyses more accessible, the Procrustes Structural Matching Alignment and Restraints Tool (ProSMART) has been developed, which achieves a conformation-independent structural alignment, as well as providing such additional functionalities as the generation of restraints for use in the refinement of macromolecular models. Sensible comparison of protein (or DNA/RNA) structures in the presence of conformational changes is achieved by enforcing neither chain nor domain rigidity. The visualization of results is facilitated by popular molecular-graphics software such as CCP4mg and PyMOL, providing intuitive feedback regarding structural conservation and subtle dissimilarities between close homologues that can otherwise be hard to identify. Automatically generated colour schemes corresponding to various residue-based scores are provided, which allow the assessment of the conservation of backbone and side-chain conformations relative to the local coordinate frame. Structural comparison tools such as ProSMART can help to break the complexity that accompanies the constantly growing pool of structural data into a more readily accessible form, potentially offering biological insight or influencing subsequent experiments.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0907-4449","1399-0047",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2014,"70",NA,9,NA,NA,NA,"2487","2499",NA,"10.1107/S1399004714016241",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000341819500023",25195761,22,"22 no 4"

To address this concern, we generated an experimental electron density map from single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing of an original mouse Pgp dataset to 3.8 angstrom resolution. The map exhibited significantly more detail compared to the original MAD map and revealed several regions of the structure that required de novo model building. The improved drug-free structure was refined to 3.8 angstrom resolution with a 9.4 and 8.1% decrease in R-work and R-free, respectively, (R-work=21.2%, R-free=26.6%) and a significant improvement in protein geometry. The improved mouse Pgp model contains approximate to 95% of residues in the favorable Ramachandran region compared to only 57% for the original model. The registry of six transmembrane helices was corrected, revealing amino acid residues involved in drug binding that were previously unrecognized. Registry shifts (rotations and translations) for three transmembrane (TM)4 and TM5 and the addition of three N-terminal residues were necessary, and were validated with new mercury labeling and anomalous Fourier density. The corrected position of TM4, which forms the frame of a portal for drug entry, had backbone atoms shifted >6 angstrom from their original positions. The drug translocation pathway of mouse Pgp is 96% identical to human Pgp and is enriched in aromatic residues that likely play a collective role in allowing a high degree of polyspecific substrate recognition.

The R383G mutant when transfected into HEK cells was not detectable on immunoblot or by functional assay, while the R383A mutant exhibited detectable but significantly decreased levels compared to wild-type, partial retention in the ER and altered glycosylation. Efflux of the ABCG2-substrates mitoxantrone and pheophorbide a was observed. Our experiments suggested rapid degradation of the R383A mutant by the proteasome via a kifunensine-insensitive pathway. Interestingly, overnight treatment of the R383A mutant with mitoxantrone assisted in protein maturation as evidenced by a shift to the N-glycosylated form. The R383A mutant when expressed in insect cells, though detected on the surface, had no measurable ATPase activity. In addition, substitution with the positively charged lysine resulted in significantly decreased protein expression levels in HEK cells, while retaining function.

Human MRP1 transports a wide range of natural product drugs and structurally diverse conjugated and unconjugated organic anions. Its closest relative is MRP3. Despite their structural similarity, the homologs differ substantially in their substrate specificity. It is noteworthy that MRP1 transports glutathione (GSH) and GSH conjugates and displays GSH-stimulated transport of a number of unconjugated and conjugated compounds. In contrast, MRP3 does not transport GSH and is a poor transporter of GSH conjugates. However, both proteins transport glucuronide conjugates, such as 17 beta-estradiol 17-(beta-D-glucuronide). We have constructed a series of MRP1/MRP3 hybrids and used them to identify a region of MRP1 that is critical for binding and transport of GSH conjugates such as leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)). Substitution of this region encompassing transmembrane helices 8 and 9 and portions of cytoplasmic loops 4 and 5 of MRP1 with the equivalent region of MRP3 eliminated LTC4 transport. Transport of other substrates was either unaffected or enhanced. We identified three residues in this region: Tyr(440), Ile(441), and Met(443), mutation of which differentially affected transport. It is noteworthy that substitution of Tyr(440) with Phe, as found in MRP3, reduced LTC(4) and GSH-stimulated estrone-3-sulfate transport without affecting transport of other substrates tested. The mutation increased the K(m) for LTC(4) 5-fold and substantially reduced photolabeling of MRP1 by both [(3)H] LTC(4) and the GSH derivative, azidophenacyl-[(35)S] GSH. These results suggest that Tyr(440) makes a major contribution to recognition of GSH and the GSH moiety of conjugates such as LTC(4).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0090-9556",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2008,"36","12",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2571","2581",NA,"10.1124/dmd.108.022491",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000261345000023",18775981,22,"22 no 11"

The analysis of luciferase activity expressed from 8OG:T-containing constructs indicated that the magnitude of erroneous transcription events involving 8-oxoguanine depended on the sequence contexts surrounding the lesion.

Although the detailed mechanism of TCR is not yet understood, it is believed to be triggered when a translocating RNA polymerase is arrested at a lesion or unusual structure in the DNA. Conventional assays for TCR require high doses of DNA damage for the statistical analysis of repair in the individual strands of DNA sequences ranging in size from a few hundred bases to 30 kb. The single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay allows detection of single- or double-strand breaks at a 10-100-fold higher level of resolution. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with the Comet assay (Comet-FISH) affords a heightened level of sensitivity for the assessment of repair in defined DNA sequences of cells treated with physiologically relevant doses of genotoxins. This approach also reveals localized susceptibility to chromosomal breakage in cells from individuals with hypersensitivity to radiation or chemotherapy. Several groups have reported preferential repair in transcriptionally active genes or chromosomal domains using Comet-FISH. The prevailing interpretation of the behavior of DNA in the Comet assay assumes that the DNA is arranged in loops and matrix-attachment sites; that supercoiled, undamaged loops are contained within the nuclear matrix and appear in Comet ""heads"", and that Comet ""tails"" consist of relaxed DNA loops containing one or more breaks. According to this model, localization of FISH probes in Comet heads signifies that loops containing the targeted sequences are free of damage. This implies that preferential repair as detected by Comet-FISH might encompass large chromosomal domains containing both transcribed and non-transcribed sequences.

The trigger is thought to be the presence of an irreversibly blocked transcription complex, which is recognised by a transcription-repair coupling factor. Many common DNA lesions do not block transcription, but are bypassed with varying degrees of efficiency and with potentially mutagenic effects on the RNA transcripts that are produced. The effect of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, at such lesions is not known: it has been suggested that Mfd may promote mutagenesis by increasing the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses non-bulky lesions, but it has also been reported that 8-oxoguanine, a major product of oxidative DNA damage that is efficiently bypassed by RNA polymerase, is subject to Mfd-dependent transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli. We have investigated the effect of Mfd during transcription of templates containing 8-oxoguanine, and various other non-bulky lesions. We show that an 8-oxoguanine in the template strand induces a transient pause in transcription, and that Mfd neither increases nor decreases the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses the lesion. We also show that Mfd can displace a transcription complex stalled at a single strand nick, and that it decreases the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses an abasic site. These activities are not affected by transcription rate, as similar results were obtained using ""fast"" and ""slow"" mutant RNA polymerases. Our findings suggest that 8-oxoguanine is unlikely to be directly targeted by the transcription-coupled repair pathway, and identify a potential role for Mfd in reducing the level of transcriptional mutagenesis caused by abasic sites.

In support of this model, a strong correlation between arrest of transcription by a lesion in vitro and TCR of that lesion in vivo has been found in most cases analyzed. TCR has been reported for oxidative DNA damage; however, very little is known about how frequently occurring and spontaneous DNA damage, such as depurination and base deamination, affects progression of the transcription complex. We have previously determined that the oxidative lesion, thymine glycol, is a significant block to transcription by T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) but has no detectable effect on transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) in a reconstituted system with all of the required factors. Another oxidative lesion, 8-oxoguanine, only slightly blocked T7 RNAP and caused RNAP II to briefly pause at the lesion before bypassing it. Because an abasic site is an intermediate in the repair of oxidative damage, it was of interest to learn whether it arrested transcription. Using in vitro transcription assays and substrates containing a specifically positioned lesion, we found that an abasic site in the transcribed strand is a 60% block to transcription by T7 RNAP but nearly a complete block to transcription by mammalian RNAP II. An abasic site in the nontranscribed strand did not block either polymerase. Our results clearly indicate that an abasic site is a much stronger block to transcription than either a thymine glycol or an 8-oxoguanine.

OGG1 repair activity also increased with age, but when analysed according to XPA genotype, the increase was observed only in those individuals with an A allele.

Conclusions: QoRTs generates an unmatched variety of quality control metrics, and can provide cross-comparisons of replicates contrasted by batch, biological sample, or experimental condition, revealing any outliers and/or systematic issues that could drive false associations or otherwise compromise downstream analyses. In addition, QoRTs simultaneously replaces the functionality of numerous other data-processing tools, and can quickly and efficiently generate quality control metrics, coverage counts (for genes, exons, and known/novel splice-junctions), and browser tracks.

Here we introduce and discuss broadly some apparent limitations but also certain developing opportunities of GWAS. We summarize the results from all the eight GWAS conducted up to date focused on suicidality outcomes; treatment emergent suicidal ideation (3 studies), suicide attempts (4 studies) and completed suicides (1 study). Clearly, there are few (if any) genome-wide significant and reproducible findings yet to be demonstrated. We then discuss and pinpoint certain future considerations in relation to sample sizes, the units of genetic associations used, study designs and outcome definitions, psychiatric diagnoses or biological measures, as well as the use of genomic sequencing. We conclude that GWAS should have a lot more potential to show in the case of suicidal outcomes, than what has yet been realized. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

If feasible, a more efficient strategy would be to include publicly available sequenced controls. However, these studies can be confounded by differences in sequencing platform; alignment, single nucleotide polymorphism and variant calling algorithms; read depth; and selection thresholds. Assuming one can match cases and controls on the basis of ethnicity and other potential confounding factors, and one has access to the aligned reads in both groups, we investigate the effect of systematic differences in read depth and selection threshold when comparing allele frequencies between cases and controls. We propose a novel likelihood-based method, the robust variance score (RVS), that substitutes genotype calls by their expected values given observed sequence data. Results: We show theoretically that the RVS eliminates read depth bias in the estimation of minor allele frequency.

There have been many recent, successful applications of WGS in establishing the etiology of complex diseases and guiding therapeutic decision-making in neoplastic and nonneoplastic diseases and in various aspects of reproductive health. However, there are major, but not insurmountable, obstacles to the increased clinical implementation of WGS, such as hidden costs, issues surrounding sequencing and analysis, quality assurance and standardization protocols, ethical dilemmas, and difficulties with interpretation of the results. CONTENT: The widespread use of WGS in routine clinical practice remains a distant proposition. Prospective trials will be needed to establish if, and for whom, the benefits of WGS will outweigh the likely substantial costs associated with follow-up tests, the risks of over-diagnosis and overtreatment, and the associated emotional distress. SUMMARY: WGS should be carefully implemented in the clinic to allow the realization of its potential to improve patient health in specific indications. To minimize harm the use of WGS for all other reasons must be carefully evaluated before clinical implementation.

Previously we reported that such genetic signatures of 281 genetic markers associated with about 130 genes can do a relatively good job of differentiating centenarians from non-centenarians particularly if the centenarians are 106 years and older. This would support our hypothesis that the genetic influence upon exceptional longevity increases with older and older (and rarer) ages.

Methods: A total of 570 strains of E. coli isolated from US retailmeats in 2006were screened for the presence of 10 QAC resistance genes [qacE, qacED1, qacF, qacG, emrE, sugE(c), sugE(p), mdfA and ydgE/ydgF]. The MICs of six common disinfectants were determined using an agar dilutionmethod. Possible associations between the presence of the gene and bacterial resistance to QACs and antimicrobials were investigated. Results: emrE, sugE(c), mdfA and ydgE/ydgF were commonly present (77.2%- 100%) in the E. coli isolates, but qac and sugE(p) were less prevalent (0.4%- 22.3%). emrE- mdfA- sugE(c)- ydgE/F was the most common QAC resistance gene profile. A significant association was found between antimicrobial resistance and the presence of sugE(p) and qacED1 (P < 0.05). Antimicrobial- resistant E. coli isolates tended to containmore diverse combinations of disinfectant resistance genes than susceptible ones. All isolates showed reduced susceptibility to five of six disinfectants compared with the control strains. Higher MICs were generally associated with the presence of qac and sugE(p) genes. Conclusions: The QAC resistance genes were commonly present among E. coli isolated from retail meats, and the qac and sugE(p) geneswere highly associatedwithmultidrug resistance phenotypes.

In this work, sequence-based prediction of relative solvent accessibility (RSA) is employed as a basis for a simple MQA method for soluble proteins, and subsequently extended to the much less explored case of (alpha-helical) membrane proteins. In analogy to soluble proteins, the level of exposure to the lipid of amino acid residues in transmembrane (TM) domains is captured in terms of the relative lipid accessibility (RLA), which is predicted from sequence using low-complexity Support Vector Regression models. On an independent set of 23 TM proteins, the new SVR-based predictor yields correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.56 between the predicted and observed RLA profiles, as opposed to CC of 0.13 for a baseline predictor that utilizes TMLIP2H empirical lipophilicity scale (with standard deviations of about 0.15). A simple MQA approach is then defined by ranking models of membrane proteins in terms of consistency between predicted and observed RLA profiles, as a measure of similarity to the native structure. The new method does not require a set of decoy models to optimize parameters, circumventing current limitations in this regard. Several different sets of models, including those generated by fragment based folding simulations, and decoys obtained by swapping TM helices to mimic errors in template based assignment, are used to assess the new approach. Predicted RLA profiles can be used to successfully discriminate near native models from non-native decoys in most cases, significantly improving the separation of correct and incorrectly folded models compared to a simple baseline approach that utilizes TMLIP2H. As suggested by the robust performance of a simple MQA method for soluble proteins that utilizes more accurate RSA predictions, further significant improvements are likely to be achieved. The steady growth in the number of resolved membrane protein structures is expected to yield enhanced RLA predictions, facilitating further efforts to improve de novo and template based prediction of membrane protein structure.",NA,NA,NA,"Meller, Jaroslaw/A-1971-2011; Adamczak, Rafal/F-2965-2014; Wagner, Michael/E-6273-2016","Meller, Jaroslaw/0000-0002-1162-8253; Wagner, Michael/0000-0003-3421-4763",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1389-2037",NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2011,"12","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"563","573",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000295323700011",21787302,26,"26 no 4"

Using electron cryomicroscopy and single-particle helical reconstruction, we have determined a three-dimensional structure of TspO at 10 angstrom resolution. The structure suggests that monomeric TspO comprises five transmembrane alpha helices that form a homodimer, which is consistent with the dimeric state observed in detergent solution.

An operon of seven genes (designated pmrHFIJKLM in S. typhimurium), which is regulated by the PmrA transcription factor and is also present in E. coli, is necessary for the maintenance of polymyxin resistance. We previously elucidated the roles of pmrHFIJK in the biosynthesis and attachment of L-Ara4N to lipid A and renamed these genes arn-BCADT, respectively. We now propose functions for the last two genes of the operon, pmrL and pmrM. Chromosomal inactivation of each of these genes in an E. coli pmrAc parent switched its phenotype from polymyxin-resistant to polymyxin-sensitive. Lipid A was no longer modified with L-Ara4N, even though the levels of the lipid-linked donor of the L-Ara4N moiety, undecaprenyl phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N, were not reduced in the mutants. However, the undecaprenyl phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N present in the mutants was less concentrated on the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane, as judged by 4-5-fold reduced labeling with the inner membrane-impermeable amine reagent N-hydroxysulfosuccin-imidobiotin. In an arnT mutant of the same pmrAc parent, which lacks the enzyme that transfers the L-Ara4N unit to lipid A but retains the same high levels of undecaprenyl phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N as the parent, N-hydroxysulfosuccin-imidobiotin labeling was not reduced. These results implicate pmrL and pmrM, but not arnT, in transporting undecaprenyl phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N across the inner membrane.

Using high-resolution genome-wide chromatin profiling, we found that a diverse set of genes can be induced to acquire locus-specific enrichment of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), with modification footprints extending several kilobases from the site of dsRNA homology and with locus specificity sufficient to distinguish the targeted locus from the other 20,000 genes in the C. elegans genome.

Three RNA silencing pathways were recognized in mammalian cells: RNA interference (RNAi), where short RNAs produced from long double-stranded RNA guide cleavage of cognate mRNAs, microRNA (miRNA) pathway, where endogenously-encoded miRNAs typically induce translational repression, and piRNA pathway, where piRNAs (PIWI-associated RNAs) guide repression of repetitive sequences in the germline. Originally, RNAi and miRNA pathways were thought to act in the cytoplasm, however, there is a growing body of evidence that these pathways also have a nuclear component. This text reviews the current evidence concerning nuclear localization and function of miRNA and RNAi pathway components. We provide evidence that TRBP, Dicer and AGO2, proteins found in the RISC-loading complex (RLC) and RISC itself, are present in the nucleus. Nonetheless, fully functional RLC is not found in the nuclear compartment which is consistent with the recent findings obtained by Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy experiments illustrating that RISC is specifically loaded within the cytoplasm and shuttles subsequently between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment, thereby allowing small RNA gene regulation in both compartments.

Synthetic RNAs complementary to gene promoters [antigene RNAs (agRNAs)] can either activate or inhibit gene expression. Activity of agRNAs is mediated by argonaute, a protein required for RNA interference. Unlike protein transcription factors, agRNAs do not bind to chromosomal DNA but recognize noncoding transcripts that overlap gene promoters or 3'-gene termini.

GPR4 is activated by extracellular protons in the physiological pH range (i.e. pH 7.7-6.8) and is coupled to the production of cAMP. Methods: We examined mice lacking GPR4 and examined glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in young and aged mice as well as in mice fed with a high fat diet. Expression profiles of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in white adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle was assessed. Results: Here we show that mice lacking GPR4 have an improved intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and increased insulin sensitivity. Insulin levels were comparable but leptin levels were increased in GPR4 KO mice. Gpr4(-/-) showed altered expression of PPAR alpha, IL-6, IL-10, TNF alpha, and TGF-1 beta in skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue, and liver. High fat diet abolished the differences in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity between Gpr4(+/+) and Gpr4(-/-) mice. In contrast, in aged mice (12 months old), the positive effect of GPR4 deficiency on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity was maintained. Liver and adipose tissue showed no major differences in the mRNA expression of pro-and anti-inflammatory factors between aged mice of both genotypes. Conclusion: Thus, GPR4 deficiency improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The effect may involve an altered balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in insulin target tissues.

To elucidate OGR1 function further, we transfected HEK293 cells with active OGR1 receptor or a mutant lacking 5 histidine residues (H5Phe-OGR1). An acute switch of extracellular pH from 8 to 7.1 (10 nmol/l vs 90 nmol/l protons) stimulated NHE and H+-ATPase activity in OGR1-transfected cells, but not in H5Phe-OGR1-transfected cells.

Upon GPR4 overexpression and activation in an acidic pH, the migration of B16F10 and TRAMP-C1 cells was substantially inhibited in comparison to the vector control. Similar results were observed in the Matrigel invasion and transendothelial invasion assays. At the molecular level, stimulation of GPR4 by acidosis induced the activation of RhoA and the formation of actin stress fibers. In addition, treating B16F10 cells with the known Rho activator CN01 (calpeptin) strongly inhibited cell migration, recapitulating the acidosis/GPR4-induced motility inhibition phenotype. To examine the biological effects in vivo. B1 6F10 melanoma cells were intravenously injected into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice and pulmonary metastasis was inhibited by approximately 80% in GPR4-overexpressing B16F10 cells in comparison to the vector control. Upon treatment with the Rho activator CN01, the phenotype of the B16F10 vector cells paralleled that of the GPR4-overexpressing cells in cell migration and metastasis assays. These findings suggest that GPR4 activation by an acidic pH inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion, and the Rho GTPase is at least partly responsible for this phenotype.

Our previous findings have suggested that sphingolipid metabolites are deeply involved in the regulation of melanogenic processes. In this study we aimed to examine sphingosylphosphorylcholine-mediated signalling pathways related to melanogenesis. Methods We determined the hypopigmenting effects and the related signalling pathways of sphingosylphosphorylcholine in Mel-Ab cells. In particular, we analysed the involvement of the G-protein-coupled receptor in sphingosylphosphorylcholine-induced MITF degradation. Key findings Western blotting revealed that sphingosylphosphorylcholine induced the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), as well as Akt. Moreover, the specific Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002 blocked the hypopigmenting effect of sphingosylphosphorylcholine and abrogated the sphingosylphosphorylcholine-mediated down-regulation of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), showing that the Akt pathway is involved in sphingosylphosphorylcholine-mediated melanin inhibition. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocked the decrease in MITF by sphingosylphosphorylcholine, but sphingosylphosphorylcholine did not decrease the level of MITF mRNA, indicating that the reduction in the level of MITF results from MITF degradation. Furthermore, pre-incubation of Mel-Ab cells with pertussis toxin completely abolished the hypopigmenting effects and the activation of ERK and Akt by sphingosylphosphorylcholine, suggesting that the effects of sphingosylphosphorylcholine are mainly dependent on the G-protein-coupled receptor).

Studies have indicated that SPC naturally occurs in plasma and a constituent of lipoproteins. Synthesis is also increased in some pathological conditions. Research has demonstrated that SPC is a potentially important lipid mediator of cell type specific functions in major tissues, such as heart, blood vessels, skin, brain and immune system. These effects are regulated via a number of different intracellular signalling cascades, also dependent upon cell type. Initial reports identifying high affinity SPC receptors at first appeared to reinforce the physiological relevance of this sphingolipid. However, these studies have now been retracted. Some SPC effects have been shown be occur via plasma membrane receptors for the related sphingolipid, sphingosine I-phosphate (SIP). Despite a lack of well-defined receptor signal transduction mechanisms and sparse pharmacological data, several key characteristics of SPC are now emerging. SPC can act as a mitogen in several different cell types and in certain circumstances, may also be a pro-inflammatory mediator. In this review, these actions of SPC are discussed with a view to understanding the potential physiological relevance of this sphingolipid. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Tissue injury, inflammation, and ischemia are usually accompanied by local tissue acidosis, the degree of associated pain or discomfort well correlated with the magnitude of acidification. Proton-sensing ion channels, transient receptor potential/vanilloid receptor subtype 1, and acid-sensing ion channel 3 are involved in acidosis-linked pain. However, whether recently identified proton-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) also have some contributions is unclear. Proton-sensing GPCRs, including OGR1, GPR4, G2A, and TDAG8, are fully activated at pH 6.4-6.8 in vitro. To understand whether the proton-sensing GPCRs are expressed in nociceptors, we cloned the four mouse genes and examined their tissue distribution and localization in pain-relevant loci, the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). The OGR1 family members were widely expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Their transcripts were expressed in the DRG, and most (75-82%) were present in small-diameter neurons responsible for nociception. Approximately 31-40% of total DRG neurons expressed at least two proton-sensing GPCRs. We have also demonstrated that gene expression of proton-sensing GPCRs is changed in ASIC3 knockout mice. Our finding suggests that proton-sensing GPCRs could have some roles in nociception or in compensation of loss of ASIC3 gene. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated these activities in vivo by comparing immunoreactivity for phosphorylated(p) SEK-1 (or MKK4, which activates JNK), c-Jun (ser63, ser73) and nuclear translocation of NFKB-p50 in tissue sections through the forebrain of control and p75(NGFR)-deficient mice. During postnatal development, SEK1 p-immunoreactivity was detectable in p75(NGFR)-positive cholinergic neurons and p75(NGFR)-negative neurons throughout the forebrain in control mice, During development, few cells contained c-Junp, although many neurons contained c-Jun. No obvious c-Jun immunostaining was present in the adult forebrain. At any age, NFKB-p50 immunoreactivity was seen in nuclei of most cells throughout the forebrain. Following fimbria fornix transection in adult mice, few basal forebrain neurons contained SEK1p while many axotomized choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons contained c-Junp and nuclear NFKB-p50. The immunostaining patterns of SEK1p, c-Junp and NFKB during development and following injury were largely similar in p75(NGFR) deficient mice. During development, cells throughout the forebrain had TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL)-labelling (a potential marker for apoptosis), however, their presence was not predicted by number of neurons stained for SEK1 p or c-Junp. These results suggest that the expected activation of the JNK pathway by p75(NGFR), as well as the expected relationship between SEK1 and downstream activation of c-Jun do not occur in the mammalian forebrain.

One of these concerns the signal transduction pathway of p75, which continues to be elusive. The evidence for the roles of ceramide, c-jun kinase and NF-kappa B is discussed: none of these are able to account satisfactorily for p75 death signalling. Negative modulation of Trk signalling by p75 could account for part of the pro-apoptotic effect, but is unlikely to be a major component. Although recent evidence indicates that the juxtamembrane region is critical for causing cell death, p75 has a well-conserved death domain. This may be important for functions other than killing. In glial cells and some neurons that express p75 but not TrkA, p75 causes cell death in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) binding. In sensory neurons and PC12 cells, p75 appears to signal constitutively. In cholinergic forebrain neurons, p75 expression leads to atrophy and downregulation of cholinergic markers, rather than cell death. The major challenges in p75 research are to define its signalling pathways, and particularly the intracellular proteins with which it interacts. Another major challenge is to develop a model that reconciles the different facets of p75, such as its ability in some situations to assist TrkA to rescue NGF-dependent neurons, but to stimulate apoptosis in others.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can promote the survival of developing cholinergic forebrain neurons in vitro and reduce their degeneration following injury in adult rats. We investigated the role of endogenous BDNF during postnatal development of these cholinergic neurons by analyzing homozygous BDNF-deficient (-/-) mice and their littermates (+/+, +/-). At P6, the number of choline acetyl-transferase- (ChAT) positive neurons in the medial septum was similar to 23% lower in BDNF-/- mice, although their brain and body weight was normal. At P15, control (+/+) littermates had similar to 45% more and similar to 45% larger ChAT-positive neurons and a much denser cholinergic hippocampal innervation than at P6, indicative of maturation of the septohippocampal system. In BDNF-/- mice, the number, size, and ChAT-immunostaining intensity of the cholinergic neurons remained the same between P6 and P15 (few mice survive longer). BDNF-/- mice had about three times more TUNEL-labeled (a marker of apoptosis) cells in the medial septum at P6, consistent with (but not proof of) the possibility that the cholinergic neurons were dying. The cholinergic hippocampal innervation in BDNF-/- mice expanded to a lesser extent than in controls and had reduced levels of acetylcholinesterase staining at P15. The developmental deficits were largely similar in the neostriatum of BDNF-/- mice.

Previous studies, however, have produced conflicting results, suggesting that genetic background and choice of control mice are critical. To try to clarify the conflicting results from previous reports, we undertook a further study of the basal forebrain in p75 knockout mice, paying particular attention to the use of genetically valid controls. The genetic backgrounds of p75 knockout and control mice used in this study were identical at 95% of loci. There was a small decrease in the number of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons in p75 knockout mice at four months of age compared with controls. This difference was no longer apparent at 15 months due to a reduction in numbers in control mice between the ages of 4 and 15 months. Cholinergic cell size in the basal forebrain was markedly increased in p75 knockout mice compared with controls. Spatial learning performance was consistently better in p75 knockout mice than in controls, and did not show any deterioration with age.

Surprisingly, there is little evidence to date that these proteins exist in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, even though other polypeptide growth factors, such as EGF, FGF, and insulin, are conserved in these species. For the neurotrophins, the evolution of NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 as a family implies that these signaling molecules may be involved in mediating additional neural activities, such as learning, memory, and behavior. Indeed, there is abundant evidence now that BDNF is involved in synapse modification, neurotransmitter release, long-term potentiation, and mechanosensation.

Previously, our laboratory suggested that p75(NGFR) induced apoptosis in a subpopulation of cholinergic forebrain neurons during postnatal development, i.e., the number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons in a control strain of mice decreased whereas it remained higher in p75(NGFR)-deficient (-/-) mice. Discrepancies with subsequent data sets in our laboratory caused us to thoroughly re-analyze the fate of these cholinergic medial septum and neostriatal neurons in new sets of p75(NGFR) -/- and two DNA control strains of mice during development. Between postnatal day (P)6 and P15 the number of ChAT-positive neurons detected in the medial septum of 129/Sv mice and Balb/c mice increased by similar to 64% and similar to 62%, respectively. This increase is contrary to previous reports from our laboratory and indicative of normal postnatal development (including an increase in ChAT-enzyme) of the cholinergic forebrain neurons. In p75(NGFR) -/- mice the number of ChAT-positive neurons in the medial septum remained constant between P6 and P15 and was similar to 31% and similar to 56% higher at P6 than 129/Sv and Balb/c mice, respectively. At P15 and adulthood, p75(NGFR) -/- mice had similar numbers of cholinergic neurons as control mice. In the developing neostriatum, the number of ChAT-positive neurons increased by similar to 56% between P6 and P15 and did not differ between p75(NGFR) -/- and control mice at any time. Analyses for apoptotic DNA fragmentation (TUNEL labeling) at P8 revealed no differences between p75(NGFR) -/- and control mice in 12 forebrain regions, including the septum and neostriatum. At all times, all mice had similar levels of acetylcholinesterase-positive cholinergic innervation of the molecular layer in the dorsal dentate gyrus. These findings suggest that the p75NGFR does not necessarily mediate apoptosis in medial septum or neostriatal cholinergic neurons during the postnatal time period. The discrepant results of the previous study are most likely due to a less rigorous application of criteria for data acquisition, including anatomical boundaries that define the nucleus.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was institutional review board approved and the requirement for informed consent was waived. A total of 148 patients with SPN lung adenocarcinoma underwent PET/CT and CT. Correlations between histopathologic scores estimated by using two predominant histologic subtypes from each surgically resected specimen and the mass of the nodule at CT or maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at PET/CT were assessed. Disease-free survival (DFS) was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to evaluate differences in each histopathologic subtype. Results: In 135 (91%) patients, tumors had a mixed subtype. The most frequently observed histologic subtypes, in decreasing order, were acinar (51%), lepidic (18%), solid (10%), and papillary (9%). DFS rates at 5 years were higher than 90% for the group of patients with nodules that showed the lepidic growth pattern, and 50% for patients with nodules that showed the micropapillary pattern. The pathologic score proved to be a significant predictor of DFS (P < .001). Both SUVmax and the mass of the nodule were closely correlated with pathologic score. Conclusion: Pathologic scoring appears to help predict DFS in patients with SPN lung adenocarcinoma and shows close correlation with imaging biomarkers including the mass of the nodule at CT and SUVmax at PET/CT.

Environment and genetic variations contribute to DKD susceptibility and progressive loss of kidney function. How the molecular mechanisms of genetic and environmental exposures interact during DKD initiation and progression is the focus of ongoing research efforts. The development of standardized, unbiased high-throughput profiling technologies of human DKD samples opens new avenues in capturing the multiple layers of DKD pathobiology. These techniques routinely interrogate analytes on a genome-wide scale generating comprehensive DKD-associated fingerprints. Linking the molecular fingerprints to deep clinical phenotypes may ultimately elucidate the intricate molecular interplay in a disease stage and subtype-specific manner. This insight will form the basis for accurate prognosis and facilitate targeted therapeutic interventions.

Osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary bone cancer in dogs, is commonly treated with adjuvant doxorubicin or carboplatin following amputation of the affected limb. We evaluated the use of gene-expression based models built in an intra-or interspecies manner to predict chemosensitivity and treatment outcome in canine OS. Models were built and evaluated using microarray gene expression and drug sensitivity data from human and canine cancer cell lines, and canine OS tumor datasets. The ""COXEN"" method was utilized to filter gene signatures between human and dog datasets based on strong co-expression patterns. Models were built using linear discriminant analysis via the misclassification penalized posterior algorithm. Results: The best doxorubicin model involved genes identified in human lines that were co-expressed and trained on canine OS tumor data, which accurately predicted clinical outcome in 73 % of dogs (p = 0.0262, binomial). The best carboplatin model utilized canine lines for gene identification and model training, with canine OS tumor data for co-expression.

The authors also discuss the challenges that must be overcome in this area, looking at the clinical application of gene expression profiling and some of the multigene assays which have gained clinical utility. Expert opinion: Current studies are challenged by a number of issues including: small sample sizes, retrospective analyses, varying chemotherapy regimens and response end points, the need for fresh frozen samples, distinct gene signatures in multiple platforms with minimal overlap and inherent microarray technological complexities.

We sought to develop pharmacogenomic predictors of Tax- and Ixa-response from a large panel of human breast tumor cell lines (BTCL), then to evaluate their performance in clinical samples. Thirty-two BTCL, representative of the molecular diversity of breast cancers (BC), were treated in vitro with Tax (paclitaxel (Pac), docetaxel (Doc)), and ixabepilone (Ixa), then classified as drug-sensitive or resistant according to their 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s).

In vitro IC50s of Pac and Doc were almost identical, whereas some Tax-resistant BTCL retained sensitivity to Ixa. GES predictors for Tax-sensitivity (333 genes) and Ixa-sensitivity (79 genes) were defined. They displayed a limited number of overlapping genes. Both were validated by leave-n-out cross-validation (n = 4; for overall accuracy (OA), P = 0.028 for Tax, and P = 0.0005 for Ixa). The GES predictor of Tax-sensitivity was tested on publicly available external datasets and significantly predicted Pac-sensitivity in 16 BTCL (P = 0.04 for OA), and pathological complete response to Pac-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in BC patients (P = 0.0045 for OA). Applying Tax and Ixa-GES to a dataset of clinically annotated early BC patients identified subsets of tumors with potentially distinct phenotypes of drug sensitivity: predicted Ixa-sensitive/Tax-resistant BC were significantly (P < 0.05, Fischer's exact test) more frequently ER/PR-positive, Ki67-negative, and luminal subtype than predicted Ixa-resistant/Tax-sensitive BC.

Each claims to provide additional prognostic information beyond conventional prognostic markers and to aid in determining who should receive systemic therapy. Evidence for their clinical utility was reviewed to determine whether any of them should be considered as routine clinical test. Methods: Peer reviewed publications, meeting abstracts, and information provided by company web sites have been reviewed to compile information regarding their clinical utility according to the following criteria; (1) Analytical validity and regulatory approval of the reference lab test. (2) Level of evidence for clinical utility. (3) Whether published evidences support prognostic and/or predictive claim. Results: While published evidences for clinical claims for OncotypeDx and Mammaprint used reference lab tests, and the supporting evidences for other tests come from academic assays before being converted to reference lab tests, results from two large randomized clinical trials testing the clinical utility of OncotypeDx and Mammaprint are still several years away and until that time none of the markers would reach level I evidence by Marker Utility Grading System. However Oncotype Dx has reached a level 1B evidence according to Simon modification to Marker Utility Grading System. Therefore OncotypeDx may be considered for routine clinical use as an adjunct to clinical and pathological information and has been incorporated into clinical guidelines in USA. While Mammaprint, MapQuantDx, and PAM50 have been repeatedly demonstrated to provide robust prognostic information, evidence for its worth as a predictive marker for chemotherapy benefit is yet to come from randomize clinical trials and therefore its utility is limited to prognostication. Meta-analysis of publicly available microarray based gene expression studies demonstrated that gene expression assays provide similar information and the most important information they provide is the proliferation activity. In untreated population, the prognostic impact of proliferation genes is limited to ER+HER2- subset since HER2+ or ER-HER2- subsets are associated with high proliferation activity. Therefore the clinical utility of these gene expression based tests is mainly for ER+HER2- subset. Since they are usually treated with adjuvant antiestrogen therapies, for their clinical utility, demonstration of the interaction between the gene expression markers and chemotherapy in anti-estrogen treated cohort in a randomized clinical trial would be required. While OncoytpeDx is the only test supported by studies in a randomized clinical trial for adjuvant chemotherapy, other gene expression based tests are expected to provide similar information. Gene expression profiling assays as more reproducible and precise surrogates for tumor grade (MapQauntDx and Theros Breast Cancer Index) are very promising assays. However, absence of definitive predefined cut-off for defining the subset that benefit from chemotherapy validated in cohorts from randomized trials limit their clinical application.

The objective of this study is the analysis of oncogenic pathways in ovarian cancer and their relation with clinical outcome. Methodology: A meta-analysis of 6 gene expression datasets was done for oncogenic pathway activation scores: AKT, beta-Catenin, BRCA, E2F1, EGFR, ER, HER2, INF alpha, INF gamma, MYC, p53, p63, PI3K, PR, RAS, SRC, STAT3, TNF alpha, and TGF beta and VEGF-A. Advanced serous papillary tumours from uniformly treated patients were selected (N = 464) to find differences independent from stage-, histology- and treatment biases. Survival and correlations with documented prognostic signatures (wound healing response signature WHR/genomic grade index GGI/invasiveness gene signature IGS) were analysed. Results: The GGI, WHR, IGS score were unexpectedly increased in chemosensitive versus chemoresistant patients. PR and RAS activation score were associated with survival outcome (p = 0.002; p = 0.004). Increased activations of beta-Catenin (p = 0.0009), E2F1 (p = 0.005), PI3K (p = 0.003) and p63 (p = 0.05) were associated with more favourable clinical outcome and were consistently correlated with three prognostic gene signatures. Conclusions: Oncogenic pathway profiling of advanced serous ovarian tumours revealed that increased beta-Catenin, E2F1, p63, PI3K, PR and RAS -pathway activation scores were significantly associated with favourable clinical outcome.

No objective diagnostic method exists at present. The aim of this study was to identify changes in miRNA expression profiles (miRNome) of these patients for the development of a quantitative diagnostic method of FM. In addition, knowledge of FM patient miRNomes should lead to a deeper understanding of the etiology and/or symptom severity of this complex disease. Methods Genome-wide expression profiling of miRNAs was assessed in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of FM patients (N=11) and population-age-matched controls (N=10) using human v16-miRbase 3D-Gene microarrays (Toray Industries, Japan). Selected miRNAs from the screen were further validated by RT-qPCR. Participating patients were long term sufferers (over 10 years) diagnosed by more than one specialist under 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria. Results Microarray analysis of FM patient PBMCs evidenced a marked downregulation of hsa-miR223-3p, hsa-miR451a, hsa-miR338-3p, hsa-miR143-3p, hsa-miR145-5p and hsa-miR21-5p (4-fold or more). All but the mildest inhibited miRNA, hsa-miR-21-5p, were validated by RT-qPCR. Globally, 20% of the miRNAs analyzed (233/1212) showed downregulation of at least 2-fold in patients. This might indicate a general de-regulation of the miRNA synthetic pathway in FM. No significant correlations between miRNA inhibition and FM cardinal symptoms could be identified. However, the patient with the lowest score for mental fatigue coincided with the mildest inhibition in four of the five miRNAs associated with the FM-group. Conclusions We propose a signature of five strikingly downregulated miRNAs (hsa-miR223-3p, hsa-miR451a, hsa-miR338-3p, hsa-miR143-3p and hsa-miR145-5p) to be used as biomarkers of FM.

A recurrent viral infection is an attractive hypothesis repeatedly found in the literature since it would explain the persistent pain and tiredness these patients suffer from. The initial striking link of two distinct orphan retroviruses: the gamma retroviruses murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related virus and the delta retrovirus T-lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2) to chronic fatigue have not been confirmed to date. Results: Genomic DNA (gDNA) from 75 fibromyalgia patients suffering from chronic fatigue and 79 age-matched local healthy controls were screened for the presence of MLV-related and HTLV-2 related proviral sequences. The XMRV env gene was amplified in 20% of samples tested (24% patients/15% healthy controls). Unexpectedly, no PCR amplifications from independent gDNA preparations of the same individuals were obtained. None of the positive samples showed presence of contaminating murine sequences previously reported by other investigators, neither contained additional regions of the virus making us conclude that the initial env amplification came from spurious air-driven amplicon contaminants. No specific HTLV-2 sequences were obtained at any time from any of the 154 quality-controlled gDNA preparations screened. Conclusions: Previous associations between MLV-related or HTLV-2 retrovirus infection with chronic fatigue must be discarded. Thus, studies showing positive amplification of HTLV-2 sequences from chronic fatigue participants should be revised for possible undetected technical problems. To avoid false positives of viral infection, not only extreme precautions should be taken when nested-PCR reactions are prepared and exhaustive foreign DNA contamination controls performed, but also consistent amplification of diverse regions of the virus in independent preparations from the same individual must be demanded. The fact that our cohort of patients did not present evidence of any of the two types of retroviral infection formerly associated to chronic fatigue does not rule out the possibility that other viruses are involved in inciting or maintaining fibromyalgia and/or chronic fatigue conditions.",NA,NA,NA,"Oltra, Elisa/I-3642-2015","Oltra, Elisa/0000-0003-0598-2907",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1743-422X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"11-Nov",2013,"10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"332","10.1186/1743-422X-10-332",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000327879100001",24216038,34,"34 no 4"

These primers were used in the PCR amplification of purified JHK virion cDNA, and ana-lysis of the resulting amplified sequence indicates that the JHKV is in the murine leukemia virus (MLV) family. The JHK sequence is nearly identical to the corresponding region of the Bxv-1 endogenous mouse retrovirus (GenBank accession AC115959) and distinct from XMRV. JHKV gag-specific amplification was demonstrated with nucleic acids from uncultivated, frozen, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the index patient, but not in PBMCs from nine healthy blood donors.

Since recent studies using animal models for infection have yielded conflicting results, we set out an ex vivo model for XMRV infection of human tonsillar tissue to determine whether XMRV produced by 22Rv1 cells is able to replicate in human lymphoid organs. Tonsil blocks were infected and infection kinetics and its pathogenic effects were monitored Results: XMRV, though restricted by APOBEC, enters and integrates into the tissue cells. The infection did not result in changes of T or B-cells, immune activation, nor inflammatory chemokines. Infectious viruses could be recovered from supernatants of infected tonsils by reinfecting DERSE XMRV indicator cell line, although these supernatants could not establish a new infection in fresh tonsil culture, indicating that in our model, the viral replication is controlled by innate antiviral restriction factors. Conclusions: Overall, the replication-competent retrovirus XMRV, present in a high number of laboratories, is able to infect human lymphoid tissue and produce infectious viruses, even though they were unable to establish a new infection in fresh tonsillar tissue.

First, we test four semi-theoretical proposals for universal behaviour of respectively the velocity, the mixing length, the eddy viscosity, and the turbulence-kinetic-energy production rate. The question is which one may carry over from zero pressure gradient, for which they all agree, to finite pressure gradients, in which case they conflict. The DNS results, which are consistent between the favorable and the adverse pressure gradients, do not agree precisely with any of the theoretical proposals, but fall between those based on velocity (i.e., the log law) and on production. We do not know of a physical explanation for this trend, which has implications for theory, modelling, and wall functions. The residual effect of pressure gradients on the velocity profile, taken at y (+)=50, is examined in a wide range of simulations and experiments, which almost all turn out to follow a weak but definite trend to fall in adverse gradients. The second use of the data is to assess the accuracy of two turbulence models of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) type. These models are used in two modes. In the traditional mode, only the U velocity component is non-zero, and it depends only on the wall-normal coordinate y. In the newer mode, the V and W components are non-zero and the flow is allowed to depend on the lateral coordinate z with periodic conditions, but still not on x or t. For both pure Couette flow and the Couette-Poiseuille case considered here, this set-up allows some RANS models with nonlinear constitutive relations to generate streamwise vortices, which fill the channel. The presence of the rolls in the RANS generally improves the agreement with DNS and experiment, both qualitatively since the vortices are a known feature of such flows, and quantitatively, especially in terms of mixing in the core region of the channel.

Global intermittency appears even in the absence of local perturbations at the surface; the only requirement is that large-scale structures several times wider than the boundary-layer height have enough space to develop. Analysis of the mean velocity, turbulence kinetic energy, and external intermittency is used to investigate the large-scale structures and corresponding differences between stably stratified Ekman flow and channel flow. Both configurations show a similar transition to the turbulence collapse, overshoot of turbulence kinetic energy, and spectral properties. Differences in the outer region resulting from the rotation of the system lead, however, to the generation of enstrophy in the non-turbulent patches of the Ekman flow.

We discuss the scaling of turbulent length scales, height of the Ekman layer, friction velocity, veering angle at the wall and heat flux. The boundary-layer thickness, the friction velocity and the veering angle depend on Lf/u(tau), where u(tau) is the friction velocity and L the Obukhov length scale, whereas the heat fluxes appear to scale with L+ = Lu-tau/v.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0022-1120","1469-7645",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2014,"755",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1017/jfm.2014.318",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000341128600035",NA,35,"35 no 3"

Mean helicity is zero in flows that are parity invariant. System rotation breaks parity invariance and has therefore the potential of giving rise to non-zero mean helicity. In this paper we study the helicity dynamics in the incompressible Ekman boundary layer. Evolution equations for the mean field helicity and the mean turbulent helicity are derived and it is shown that pressure flux injects helicity at a rate 2 Omega G(2) over the total depth of the Ekman layer, where G is the geostrophic wind far from the wall and Omega = Omega e(y) is the rotation vector and e(y) is the wall-normal unit vector. Thus right-handed/left-handed helicity will be injected if Omega is positive/negative. We also show that in the uppermost part of the boundary layer there is a net helicity injection with opposite sign as compared with the totally integrated injection. Isotropic relations for the helicity dissipation and the helicity spectrum are derived and it is shown that it is sufficient to measure two transverse velocity components and use Taylor's hypothesis in the mean flow direction in order to measure the isotropic helicity spectrum. We compare the theoretical predictions with a direct numerical simulation of an Ekman boundary layer and confirm that there is a preference for right-handed helicity in the lower part of the Ekman layer and left-handed helicity in the uppermost part when Omega > 0. In the logarithmic range, the helicity dissipation conforms to isotropic relations. On the other hand, spectra show significant departures from isotropic conditions, suggesting that the Reynolds number considered in the study is not sufficiently large for isotropy to be valid in a wide range of scales. Our analytical and numerical results strongly suggest that there is a turbulent helicity cascade of right-handed helicity in the logarithmic range of the atmospheric boundary layer when Omega > 0, consistent with recent measurements by Koprov, Koprov, Ponomarev & Chkhetiani (Dokl.

The very long computational domain provides substantial assessment for suggested high Reynolds number (Re) trends. Statistics, integral quantities and spectral data are validated using high quality direct numerical simulation (DNS) ranging up to Re-theta = 4300 and hot-wire measurements covering the remaining Re-range. The mean velocity, turbulent fluctuations, skin friction, and shape factor show excellent agreement with the reference data. Through utilisation of filtered DNS, subtle differences between the LES and DNS could to a large extent be explained by the reduced spanwise resolution of the LES. Spectra and correlations for the streamwise velocity and the wall-shear stress evidence a clear scale-separation and a footprint of large outer scales on the near-wall small scales. While the inner peak decreases in importance and reduces to 4% of the total energy at the end of the domain, the energy of the outer peak scales in outer units. In the near-wall region a clear k(-1) region emerges. Consideration of the two-dimensional spectra in time and spanwise space reveals that an outer time scale lambda(t) approximate to 10 delta(99)/U-infinity, with the boundary layer thickness 599 and free-stream velocity U-infinity, is the correct scale throughout the boundary layer rather than the transformed streamwise wavelength multiplied by a (scale independent) convection velocity. Maps for the covariance of small scale energy and large scale motions exhibit a stronger linear Re dependence for the amplitude of the off-diagonal peak compared to the diagonal one, thereby indicating that the strength of the amplitude modulation can only qualitatively be assessed through the diagonal peak. In addition, the magnitude of the wall-pressure fluctuations confirms mixed scaling, and pressure spectra at the highest Re give a first indication of a -7/3 wave number dependence.

Similarities and differences with respect to billows developing in the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) unidirectional stratified shear flow are discussed. Prandtl number effects are investigated as well as the role played by the buoyant-convective instability. For low Prandtl number, the amplitude of the saturated rolls vanishes at the critical bulk Richardson number, while at high Prandtl number, finite-amplitude rolls are found. The Prandtl number also affects how the growth rate of the secondary instability evolves as the Richardson number is increased. For low Prandtl number, the growth rate decreases as the Richardson number increases while it remains significant for large Prandtl number over the range of stratification studied. This behaviour is likely a result of the differing amplitudes of the roll vortices. Furthermore, the most unstable wave vector is much lower than for the secondary instability of KH billows.

The same flow is also simulated with disks absent. Relative to the latter, the peak shear stress is doubled and located at the top of the disks; with a disk spacing of 5 diameters, the array efficiency is reduced to below 30%, in approximate agreement with the predictions of simple models approximating the turbines as roughness. The disks increase the boundary-layer depth, and the ratio of the ageostrophic to the geostrophic velocity component within the boundary layer, so that the Ekman spiral becomes more pronounced. These effects are required for the satisfaction of the global kinetic energy balance: the power output of the array is directly linked to the integral of the ageostrophic velocity over the boundary-layer depth. At disk height, the power extracted by the disks is locally balanced largely by the turbulent transport of mean flow kinetic energy. However, the increased turbulence kinetic energy production attributed to the disks is a large fraction of the power abstracted by them.

In agreement with previous results, it is found that the fluctuations of the transverse velocities and of the pressure are stronger in the boundary layer, and this is traced to the pressure fluctuations induced in the outer intermittent layer by the differences between the potential and rotational flow regions. The same effect is also shown to be responsible for the stronger wake component of the mean velocity profile in external flows, whose increased energy production is the ultimate reason for the stronger fluctuations. Contrary to some previous results by our group, and by others, the streamwise velocity fluctuations are also found to be higher in boundary layers, although the effect is weaker.

However, mounting evidence suggests phytochemical-induced germination inhibition can be an adaptive response to competitive conditions, not the consequence of toxin exposure. That is, selective advantages can exist for seeds to chemically recognize potential competitor presence and defer germination until better establishment conditions occur. This Biochemical Recognition Hypothesis (BRH) contrasts the allelopathy paradigm by predicting greater germination inhibition following phytochemical exposure of sympatric compared to allopatric species. In a glasshouse, we grew 12 species native to Argentinean and North American grasslands and tested whether phytochemical leachates from co-occurring species reduced seedling emergence more than those having no historic association. Two species had 13% and 27% emergence reductions following leachate exposure of sympatric relative to allopatric species, supporting species-specific BR. Intraspecific leachates reduced emergence more than those from heterospecifics, suggesting within-species BR may be common. Only the four smallest seeded species exhibited heterospecific BR responses, suggesting that selection for assessing local competition potential may intensify as seed reserves decline. Importantly, leachate origin did not affect seedling biomass nor accelerate germination, indicating a non-toxic biochemical effect on germination reduction but not growth.Synthesis. Coupling ample theoretical support with empirical evidence here and elsewhere, an eavesdrop-and-wait' competition avoidance strategy could be a common phenomenon. Our findings suggest sympatric association may contribute to evolution of species-specific BR and that seed traits are important in its development. The underlying mechanism affecting these germination decisions may be simple phytochemical-induced hormonal regulation. Factors preclude BR from being ubiquitous but nonetheless, BR provides a potentially powerful mechanism by which some plant populations and the spatiotemporal diversity of some communities are structured. Lastly, allelopathy may be erroneously invoked when phytochemical-induced germination reduction occurs but a toxicity mechanism has not been elucidated.

Results: Koeleria biomass did not differ in low- and high-light treatments when grown alone and was highly suppressed by C. stoebe in both low and high light; however, high-light activated carbon treatments designed to ameliorate root-mediated allelopathic effects resulted in an almost seven-fold increase in Koeleria mass in comparison to no carbon treatments.

In a non-native range (Montana), soil nitrate (NO(3) (-)) concentrations were lower in invaded than uninvaded grasslands. This did not appear to be due only to higher uptake rates as both C. stoebe plants and catechin significantly reduced resin extractable NO(3) (-), the maximum rate of nitrification, and gross nitrification in Montana soils. Thus, reduced NO(3) (-) in invaded communities may be due in part to the inhibition of nitrifying bacteria by secondary metabolites produced by C. stoebe. The effects of C. stoebe on N-related processes were different in Romanian grasslands, where C. stoebe is native. In Romanian soil, C. stoebe had no effect on resin extractable NH(4) (+) or NO(3) (-) (compared to other plant species), the maximum rate of nitrification, nor gross nitrification.

Interactions among plants and their consumers, pollinators and dispersers are central to evolutionary theory, but interactions among plants themselves have received much less attention. Thus focusing more attention on the evolutionary role of plant-plant interactions may provide greater insight into the processes that organize communities. 2. Here, we integrate divergent themes in the literature in an effort to provide a synthesis of empirical evidence and ideas about how plant interactions may affect evolution and how evolution may affect plant interactions. 3. First, we discuss the idea of niche partitioning evolving through competitive interactions among plants, the idea of niche construction evolving through facilitative interactions, and the connections between these ideas and more recent research on diversity and ecosystem function and trait-based community organization. 4. We then review how a history of coexistence within a region might affect competitive outcomes and explore the mechanisms by which plants exert selective forces on each other. Next, we consider recent research on invasions suggesting that plant interactions can reflect regional evolutionary trajectories. Finally, we place these lines of research into the context of extended phenotypes and the geographic mosaic of co-evolution. 5. Synthesis.

We used field sampling and greenhouse experiments to examine two questions: (1) Is increasing abundance of C. stoebe negatively associated with the abundance of specific native grassland species? (2) Do species that exhibit a negative correlation with C. stoebe abundance in the field demonstrate increased levels of susceptibility to application of (+/-)-catechin during germination? Thirty-eight plots were sampled in the grassland, encompassing areas of low-high knapweed abundance.

Catechin is a natural flavanoid implicated in the potential allelopathic interactions of Centaurea stoebe. However, recent studies have shown that catechin is highly unstable and not likely to accumulate in growing medium at phytotoxic concentrations. All previous studies that investigated the allelopathic potential of catechin assumed a continuous exudation of this compound by C. stoebe. Contrary to this, but similar to many other plant secondary metabolites, we hypothesized that catechin exudation may exhibit a pulsed pattern that could facilitate its transient accumulation. Further, we aimed at optimizing a more sensitive detection technique. We tested the hypothesis by quantifying the diurnal pattern of catechin release by C. stoebe in a hydroponic system. Using sample processing, based on a solid phase extraction technique, and more sensitive fluorescent detection parameters, we were able to quantify catechin in the picomolar range from the growing medium.

For example, plants modify the soil environment through root exudates that affect soil structure, and mobilize and/or chelate nutrients. The long-term impact of litter and root exudates can modify soil nutrient pools, and there is evidence that invasive plant species may alter nutrient cycles differently from native species. The effects of plants on ecosystem biogeochemistry may be caused by differences in leaf tissue nutrient stoichiometry or secondary metabolites, although evidence for the importance of allelochemicals in driving these processes is lacking. Some invasive species may gain a competitive advantage through the release of compounds or combinations of compounds that are unique to the invaded community-the ""novel weapons hypothesis."" Invasive plants also can exert profound impact on plant communities indirectly through the herbicides used to control them. Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide in the world, often is used to help control invasive weeds, and generally is considered to have minimal environmental impacts. Most studies show little to no effect of glyphosate and other herbicides on soil microbial communities. However, herbicide applications can reduce or promote rhizobium nodulation and mycorrhiza formation. Herbicide drift can affect the growth of non-target plants, and glyphosate and other herbicides can impact significantly the secondary chemistry of plants at sublethal doses. In summary, the literature indicates that invasive species can alter the biogeochemistry of ecosystems, that secondary metabolites released by invasive species may play important roles in soil chemistry as well as plant-plant and plant-microbe interactions, and that the herbicides used to control invasive species can impact plant chemistry and ecosystems in ways that have yet to be fully explored.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-0331",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2010,"36","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"59","69",NA,"10.1007/s10886-009-9735-0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000274332500006",20077127,36,"36 no 11"

GPR4 is activated by extracellular protons in the physiological pH range (i.e. pH 7.7-6.8) and is coupled to the production of cAMP. Methods: We examined mice lacking GPR4 and examined glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in young and aged mice as well as in mice fed with a high fat diet. Expression profiles of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in white adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle was assessed. Results: Here we show that mice lacking GPR4 have an improved intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and increased insulin sensitivity. Insulin levels were comparable but leptin levels were increased in GPR4 KO mice. Gpr4(-/-) showed altered expression of PPAR alpha, IL-6, IL-10, TNF alpha, and TGF-1 beta in skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue, and liver. High fat diet abolished the differences in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity between Gpr4(+/+) and Gpr4(-/-) mice. In contrast, in aged mice (12 months old), the positive effect of GPR4 deficiency on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity was maintained. Liver and adipose tissue showed no major differences in the mRNA expression of pro-and anti-inflammatory factors between aged mice of both genotypes. Conclusion: Thus, GPR4 deficiency improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The effect may involve an altered balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in insulin target tissues.

To elucidate OGR1 function further, we transfected HEK293 cells with active OGR1 receptor or a mutant lacking 5 histidine residues (H5Phe-OGR1). An acute switch of extracellular pH from 8 to 7.1 (10 nmol/l vs 90 nmol/l protons) stimulated NHE and H+-ATPase activity in OGR1-transfected cells, but not in H5Phe-OGR1-transfected cells. ZnCl2 and CuCl2 that both inhibit OGR1 reduced the stimulatory effect. The activity was blocked by chelerythrine, whereas the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD 098059 had no inhibitory effect. OGR1 activation increased intracellular calcium in transfected HEK293 cells. We next isolated proximal tubules from kidneys of wild-type and OGR1-deficient mice and measured the effect of extracellular pH on NHE activity in vitro. Deletion of OGR1 affected the pH-dependent proton extrusion, however, in the opposite direction as expected from cell culture experiments. Upregulated expression of the pH-sensitive kinase Pyk2 in OGR1 KO mouse proximal tubule cells may compensate for the loss of OGR1. Thus, we present the first evidence that OGR1 modulates the activity of two major plasma membrane proton transport systems.

Upon GPR4 overexpression and activation in an acidic pH, the migration of B16F10 and TRAMP-C1 cells was substantially inhibited in comparison to the vector control. Similar results were observed in the Matrigel invasion and transendothelial invasion assays. At the molecular level, stimulation of GPR4 by acidosis induced the activation of RhoA and the formation of actin stress fibers. In addition, treating B16F10 cells with the known Rho activator CN01 (calpeptin) strongly inhibited cell migration, recapitulating the acidosis/GPR4-induced motility inhibition phenotype. To examine the biological effects in vivo. B1 6F10 melanoma cells were intravenously injected into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice and pulmonary metastasis was inhibited by approximately 80% in GPR4-overexpressing B16F10 cells in comparison to the vector control. Upon treatment with the Rho activator CN01, the phenotype of the B16F10 vector cells paralleled that of the GPR4-overexpressing cells in cell migration and metastasis assays. These findings suggest that GPR4 activation by an acidic pH inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion, and the Rho GTPase is at least partly responsible for this phenotype.

To gain insight into the mechanism of action of nTregs in pathological and physiological immune responses, it is important to analyze bioactive molecules that modulate the maintenance and function of nTregs. From a library of bioactive lipids, we obtained lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) as a molecule that enhanced the Foxp3 expression and suppressive function of human nTregs significantly in comparison with those of DMSO-treated nTregs (control). The expression levels of TGF-beta 1 mRNA and protein in LPC-treated nTregs were significantly higher than those in control nTregs. After treatment with anti-TGF-beta 1 antibody, the increases in Foxp3 expression and the suppressive properties of LPC-treated nTregs returned to the levels observed in control nTregs. These findings indicate that LPC enhances Foxp3 expression and the suppressive function of nTregs through TGF-beta 1 produced by nTregs themselves. Experimental knockdown of G2A and GPR4 showed that this LPC-induced TGF-beta 1 expression in nTregs was due to G2A signaling, and did not involve GPR4. Moreover, JNK was a major contributor to LPC-induced TGF-beta 1 expression in nTregs, although LPC activated MAPKs including ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK via G2A. LPC is a bioactive lysolipid highly abundant in the circulation. Therefore, LPC may contribute to the maintenance and function of human nTregs in vivo. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Whereas the tissue microenvironments are often acidic at inflammatory sites, the mechanisms by which cells respond to acidosis are not well understood. Using molecular, cellular and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that activation of GPR4, a proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptor, by isocapnic acidosis increases the adhesiveness of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that express GPR4 endogenously. Acidosis in combination with GPR4 overexpression further augments HUVEC adhesion with U937 monocytes. In contrast, overexpression of a G protein signaling-defective DRY motif mutant (R115A) of GPR4 does not elicit any increase of HUVEC adhesion, indicating the requirement of G protein signaling. Downregulation of GPR4 expression by RNA interference reduces the acidosis-induced HUVEC adhesion. To delineate downstream pathways, we show that inhibition of adenylate cyclase by inhibitors, 29,59-dideoxyadenosine (DDA) or SQ 22536, attenuates acidosis/GPR4-induced HUVEC adhesion. Consistently, treatment with a cAMP analog or a G(i) signaling inhibitor increases HUVEC adhesiveness, suggesting a role of the G(s)/cAMP signaling in this process. We further show that the cAMP downstream effector Epac is important for acidosis/GPR4-induced cell adhesion. Moreover, activation of GPR4 by acidosis increases the expression of vascular adhesion molecules E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which are functionally involved in acidosis/GPR4-mediated HUVEC adhesion. Similarly, hypercapnic acidosis can also activate GPR4 to stimulate HUVEC adhesion molecule expression and adhesiveness.

Approximately 31-40% of total DRG neurons expressed at least two proton-sensing GPCRs. We have also demonstrated that gene expression of proton-sensing GPCRs is changed in ASIC3 knockout mice. Our finding suggests that proton-sensing GPCRs could have some roles in nociception or in compensation of loss of ASIC3 gene. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, the signaling pathways leading to LPA(4)-mediated induction of cAMP and calcium levels have not been reported. Using epitope-tagged LPA(4), pharmacological intervention, and G protein mini-genes, we provide independent confirmatory evidence that supports LPA(4) as a fourth LPA receptor, including LPA concentration-dependent responses and specific membrane binding. Importantly, we further demonstrate new LPA-dependent activities of LPA, that include the following: receptor internalization; G(12/13)- and Rho-mediated neurite retraction and stress fiber formation; G(q) protein and pertussis toxin-sensitive calcium mobilization and activation of a nonselective cation conductance; and cAMP increases mediated by G(s). The receptor is broadly expressed in embryonic tissues, including brain, as determined by Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Adult tissues have increased expression in skin, heart, and to a lesser extent, thymus.

Divergence may be gradual, involving simple amino acid residue substitutions, or drastic, such that larger structural elements are inserted, deleted or rearranged. Vast protein sequence comparisons, supported by some experimental evidence, argue that large structural modifications have been necessary for certain catalytic activities to evolve. However, it is not clear whether these activities could not have been attained by gradual changes. Interestingly, catalytic promiscuity could play a fundamental evolutionary role: a preexistent secondary activity could be increased by simple amino acid residue substitutions that do not affect the enzymes primary activity. The promiscuous profile of the enzyme may be modified gradually by genetic drift, making a pool of potentially useful activities that can be selected before duplication. In this work, we used random mutagenesis and in vivo selection to evolve the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 carboxylesterase PA3859, a small protein, to attain the function of BioH, a much larger paralog involved in biotin biosynthesis. BioH was chosen as a target activity because it provides a highly sensitive selection for evolved enzymatic activities by auxotrophy complementation. After only two cycles of directed evolution, mutants with the ability to efficiently complement biotin auxotrophy were selected.

In contrast to bacterial systems, there is little quantitative information available regarding multiple vector transformants in yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most widely used eukaryotic platform for cell surface display, combinatorial protein engineering, and other recombinant library screens. In order to characterize the extent and nature of multiple vector transformants in this important host, plasmid-born gene libraries constructed by yeast homologous recombination were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Results: It was found that up to 90% of clones in yeast homologous recombination libraries may be multiple vector transformants, that on average these clones bear four or more unique mutant genes, and that these multiple vector cells persist as a significant proportion of library populations for greater than 24 hours during liquid outgrowth. Both vector concentration and vector to insert ratio influenced the library proportion of multiple vector transformants, but their population frequency was independent of transformation efficiency. Interestingly, the average number of plasmids born by multiple vector transformants did not vary with their library population proportion. Conclusion: These results highlight the potential for multiple vector transformants to dominate yeast libraries constructed by homologous recombination. The previously unrecognized prevalence and persistence of multiply transformed yeast cells have important implications for yeast library screens. The quantitative information described herein should increase awareness of this issue, and the rapid sequencing approach developed for these studies should be widely useful for identifying multiple vector transformants and avoiding complications associated with cells that have acquired more than one unique plasmid.",NA,NA,NA,"Griswold, Karl/B-3449-2012;","Griswold, Karl/0000-0002-9835-3394",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1472-6750",NA,NA,NA,NA,"20-Nov",2009,"9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"95","10.1186/1472-6750-9-95",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000272337200001",19930565,40,"40 no 3"

We find that plasmids are not rapidly lost, but are able to persist in bacteria for multiple overnight growth cycles, with some dependence upon the nature of the antibiotic selected for.

The review of published accounts also shows that the publication of scientific papers containing recognizable fraudulent material is very low, probably less than 0.02% and extremely difficult to detect. Because most reported cases of fraud have involved research done at prestigious organizations with distinguished co-authors, and that is published in journals with exacting review processes, it becomes evident that some unscrupulous scientists are adept at fabricating and falsifying data. However, ""significant"" scientific fraud is detected when scientists repeatedly report results that cannot be independently verified, when colleagues report suspicious behaviour, or scientific audits are performed. This review documents and compares many of the better-known cases of scientific fraud.

A comparative bioinformatics evaluation of the conservation and organization of the genes of Trp biosynthesis in prokaryotic operons should serve as an excellent model for assessing the feasibility of predicting the evolutionary histories of genes and operons associated with other biochemical pathways. These comparisons should provide a better understanding of possible explanations for differences in operon organization in different organisms at a genomics level. These analyses may also permit identification of some of the prevailing forces that dictated specific gene rearrangements during the course of evolution. Operons concerned with Trp biosynthesis in prokarvotes have been in a dynamic state of flux. Analysis of closely related organisms among the Bacteria at various phylogenetic nodes reveals many examples of operon scission, gene dispersal, gene fusion, gene scrambling, and gene loss from which the direction of evolutionary events can be deduced. Two milestone evolutionary events have been mapped to the 16S rRNA tree of Bacteria, one splitting the operon in two, and the other rejoining it by gene fusion. The Archaea, though less resolved due to a lesser genome representation, appear to exhibit more gene scrambling than the Bacteria. The trp operon appears to have been an ancient innovation; it was already present in the common ancestor of Bacteria and Archaea. Although the operon has been subjected, even in recent times, to dynamic changes in gene rearrangement, the ancestral gene order can be deduced with confidence. The evolutionary history of the genes of the pathway is discernible in rough outline as a vertical line of descent, with events of lateral gene transfer or paralogy enriching the analysis as interesting features that can be distinguished. As additional genomes are thoroughly analyzed, an increasingly refined resolution of the sequential evolutionary steps is clearly possible. These comparisons suggest that present-day trp operons that possess finely tuned regulatory features are under strong positive selection and are able to resist the disruptive evolutionary events that may be experienced by simpler, poorly regulated operons.",NA,NA,NA,"Keyhani, Nemat/I-8150-2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1092-2172",NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2003,"67","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"303","+",NA,"10.1128/MMBR.67.3.303-342.2003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000185342200001",12966138,40,"40 no 9"

However, despite demonstrable immune response, cancers grow progressively suggesting that priming of antitumor immunity is insufficiently vigorous or that antitumor immunity is suppressed, or both. Compared to virus infection, antitumor T cells are low abundance that likely contributes to tumor escape and enhancement of priming is a long-sought goal of experimental vaccination therapy. Furthermore, patient treatment with antigen-specific T cells can in some cases overcome deficient priming and cause tumor regression supporting the notion that low numbers of T cells permits tumor outgrowth. However, tumor-induced suppression of antitumor immune response is now recognized as a significant factor contributing to cancer growth and reversal of the inhibitory influences within the tumor microenvironment is a major research objective. Multiple cell types and factors can inhibit T cell functions in tumors and may be grouped in two general classes: T cell intrinsic and T cell extrinsic. T cell intrinsic factors are exemplified by T cell expression of cell surface inhibitory signaling receptors that, after contact with cells expressing a cognate ligand, inactivate proximal T Cell Receptor-mediated signal transduction therein rendering T cells dysfunctional. T cell extrinsic factors are more diverse in nature and are produced by tumors and various non-tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. These include proteins secreted by tumor or stromal cells, highly reactive soluble oxygen and nitrogen species, cytokines, chemokines, gangliosides, and toxic metabolites. These factors may restrict T cell entrance into the tumor parenchyma, cause inactivation of effector phase T cell functions, or induce T cell apoptosis ultimately causing diminished cancer elimination. Here, we review the contributions of inhibitory factors to tumor T cell dysfunction leading to tumor escape. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of the retraction notices for 423 articles indexed in PubMed revealed that the most common causes of error-related retraction are laboratory errors, analytical errors, and irreproducible results. The most common laboratory errors are contamination and problems relating to molecular biology procedures (e.g., sequencing, cloning). Retractions due to contamination were more common in the past, whereas analytical errors are now increasing in frequency. A number of publications that have not been retracted despite being shown to contain significant errors suggest that barriers to retraction may impede correction of the literature. In particular, few cases of retraction due to cell line contamination were found despite recognition that this problem has affected numerous publications. An understanding of the errors leading to retraction can guide practices to improve laboratory research and the integrity of the scientific literature.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Fas (CD95) as well as FasL (CD95L) expression in primary malignant melanoma and melanoma metastases on overall survival (OS). Patients and Methods: 19 patients with metastatic malignant melanoma who were treated with different dacarbazine (DTIC)-based chemotherapy regimens were included in this study. From each patient, primary melanoma biopsies and biopsies from metastases were histologically evaluated. Immunohistology was performed with antibodies to Fas/CD95 and FasL/CD95L. Differences in OS were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log rank test. Results: Fas/CD95 and FasL/CD95L expression was detected in 73.7 and 63.2% of primary melanomas, respectively. In metastases, expression of both Fas/CD95 (63.2%) and FasL/CD95L (47.4%) was markedly decreased. Presence of FasL/CD95L expression in primary melanoma resulted in significantly (p = 0.024) prolonged OS compared with FasL/CD95L-negative high-risk primary melanomas. In contrast, loss of FasL/CD95L expression in melanoma metastases resected before chemotherapy was associated with significantly prolonged median survival (p = 0.0139).

Tubular epithelium-derived FasL induced apoptosis in Fas-sensitive lymphoid cell lines but not in Fas-resistant lymphoid cell Lines. By contrast, MCT cells grown in the presence of the survival factors of serum were resistant to FasL, and only became partially sensitive to apoptosis induced by high concentrations (100 ng/ml) of FasL upon serum deprivation. However, MCT cells stimulated with inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and lipopolysaccharide) increased cell surface Fas expression and were sensitized to apoptosis induced by FasL (FasL 55 +/- 5% versus control 8.3 +/- 4.1% apoptotic cells at 24 h, P < 0.05).

In recent years the existence of L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and the generation of the reactive nitrogen species (RNS) nitric oxide (NO) have been demonstrated in plant peroxisomes. The inter-cellular and intracellular NO carrier S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) can be generated inside peroxisomes and the presence of this RNS has been demonstrated in peroxisomes from several plant species. This review analyzes the available evidence concerning the properties of the NOS activity and the generation of the RNS messengers NO and GSNO in peroxisomes in the context of the cellular function of these organelles as a source of RNS signaling molecules. The important physiological functions displayed by NO and other RNS in intra- and inter-cellular communication in different organisms indicate that more attention should be payed to the RNS signaling function of peroxisomes in human, animal and fungal cells, where it is very likely that similar mechanisms to those found in plant peroxisomes are also operative.

This article reports experiments designed to investigate whether elevated NO reduces the adhesion of zoospores of the green alga Ulva, an important fouling species. Surface-normalised values of NO were measured using the fluorescent indicator DAF-FM DA and parallel hydrodynamic measurements of adhesion strength were made. Elevated levels of NO caused by the addition of the exogenous NO donor SNAP reduced spore settlement by 20% and resulted in lower adhesion strength. Addition of the NO scavenger cPTIO abolished the effects of SNAP on adhesion. The strength of attachment and NO production by spores in response to four coatings (Silastic (R) T2; Intersleek (R) 700; Intersleek (R) 900 and polyurethane) shows that reduced adhesion is correlated with an increase in NO production.

Bioinformatic analysis revealed the four subunits of the GCC in the L. major genome, and the role of the GCC in parasite metabolism and virulence was assessed through studies of the P subunit (glycine decarboxylase (GCVP)). First, a tagged GCVP protein was expressed and localized to the parasite mitochondrion. Second, a gcvP(-) mutant was generated and shown to lack significant GCC activity using an indirect in vivo assay after incorporation of label from [2-C-14] glycine into DNA. The gcvP(-) mutant grew poorly in the presence of excess glycine or minimal serine; these studies also established that L. major promastigotes require serine for optimal growth. Although gcvP(-) promastigotes and amastigotes showed normal virulence in macrophage infections in vitro, both forms of the parasite showed substantially delayed replication and lesion pathology in infections of both genetically susceptible or resistant mice. These data suggest that, as the physiology of the infection site changes during the course of infection, so do the metabolic constraints on parasite replication. This conclusion has great significance to the interpretation of metabolic requirements for virulence. Last, these studies call attention in trypanosomatid protozoa to the key metabolic intermediate 5,10-CH2-THF, situated at the junction of serine, glycine, and thymidylate metabolism.

This review summarizes the current knowledge and understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NO synthesis and signalling in plant cells. Findings NO has been shown to participate in vital developmental processes in plants like germination, tissue differentiation, growth, flowering and senescence. NO functions as a signalling molecule in plant responses to abiotic and biotic external stimuli. NO can be produced by several different enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions, depending on the plant cell type. Actually, the identity and role of plant homologues of animal NO synthases has not been clearly described, while nitrite-dependent NO production by nitrate reductase has been demonstrated in several plant species. High reactivity and mobility of NO in plant cell is the basis for its complex reactions and a wide array of plausible molecular targets. Intracellular downstream NO signalling includes cGMP- and cADP-ribose cascade leading to changes in the intracellular Ca2+ level. NO signalling can be mediated by microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinases or effected by covalent protein modifications such as cysteine nitrosylation. Conclusions Despite considerable advances in plant NO research, our understanding of NO signalling pathways is still very limited. Current research is focused on the identification of tissue and subcellular specific NO synthesis and its fate as well as on the crosstalk of NO with signalling pathways of reactive oxygen species and plant hormones. The employment of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with altered expression of enzymes involved in NO synthesis or metabolism will substantially contribute to the elucidation of the NO role in plant cell signalling.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0009-2770",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2008,"102","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"410","416",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000257129500002",NA,44,"44 no 10"

Central statistical monitoring (CSM) is a cheaper alternative, where data checks are performed by the coordinating centre, avoiding the need to visit all sites. Several publications have suggested methods for CSM; however, few have described their use in real trials. Methods R-programs were created to check data at either the subject level (7 tests within 3 programs) or site level (9 tests within 8 programs) using previously described methods or new ones we developed. These aimed to find possible data errors such as outliers, incorrect dates, or anomalous data patterns; digit preference, values too close or too far from the means, unusual correlation structures, extreme variances which may indicate fraud or procedural errors and under-reporting of adverse events. The methods were applied to three trials, one of which had closed and has been published, one in follow-up, and a third to which fabricated data were added. We examined how well the methods work, discussing their strengths and limitations. Results The R-programs produced simple tables or easy-to-read figures. Few data errors were found in the first two trials, and those added to the third were easily detected. The programs were able to identify patients with outliers based on single or multiple variables. They also detected (1) fabricated patients, generated to have values too close to the multivariate mean, or with too low variances in repeated measurements, and (2) sites which had unusual correlation structures or too few adverse events. Some methods were unreliable if applied to centres with few patients or if data were fabricated in a way which did not fit the assumptions used to create the programs. Outputs from the R-programs are interpreted using examples. Limitations Detecting data errors is relatively straightforward; however, there are several limitations in the detection of fraud: some programs cannot be applied to small trials or to centres with few patients (<10) and data falsified in a manner which does not fit the program's assumptions may not be detected. In addition, many tests require a visual assessment of the output (showing flagged participants or sites), before data queries are made or on-site visits performed. Conclusions CSM is a worthwhile alternative to on-site data checking and may be used to limit the number of site visits by targeting only sites which are picked up by the programs. We summarise the methods, show how they are implemented and that they can be easy to interpret. The methods can identify incorrect or unusual data for a trial subject, or centres where the data considered together are too different to other centres and therefore should be reviewed, possibly through an on-site visit.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cox, Trevor/0000-0003-3045-5594",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1740-7745","1740-7753",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2013,"10","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"783","806",NA,"10.1177/1740774513494504",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000330526300019",24130202,49,"49 no 2"

Approximately 3000 articles describing Budd-Chiari syndrome in China have been published. However, no study has yet explored the prevalence of covert duplicate publications among these articles. METHODS: We retrieved original articles regarding Budd-Chiari syndrome in China via the PubMed, Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal (VIP), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. The prevalence of covert duplicate publications was evaluated across publication dates, institutional grades, and academic levels of the journals. RESULTS: Overall, 1914 articles were included in our analysis. These articles were produced by 632 institutions and published in 463 journals. Overall, 10% (184/1914) of the articles, 10% (62/632) of the institutions, and 26% (119/463) of the journals were involved in covert duplicate publications. A decreasing trend in the prevalence of covert duplicate publications over time was observed. The prevalence of covert duplicate publications was significantly higher in tertiary hospitals than in primary hospitals or unclassified institutions (10.0% vs 3.8%, P = .038), but the prevalence was similar between tertiary and secondary hospitals (10.0% vs 9.3%, P = .72). The prevalence of covert duplicate publications was significantly higher in Science Citation Index journals than in Chinese Academic Core journals (23.9% vs 10.3%, P = .001) and other journals (23.9% vs 8.3%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Covert duplicate publications are relatively common among articles on Budd-Chiari syndrome in China. The high prevalence of covert duplicate publication in Science Citation Index journals should remind English-language journal editors to verify whether the articles submitted by Chinese researchers have been published in Chinese-language journals.

Transarterial embolisation (TAE) and transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) have become standard loco-regional treatments for unresectable HCC. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of TACE or TAE. Search strategy We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Cancer Network register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and The Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) from dates of inceptions up to September 2010. Selection criteria We considered for inclusion all randomised trials that compared TACE or TAE versus placebo, sham, or no intervention. Co-interventions were allowed if comparable between intervention groups. Trials with inadequate randomisation were excluded. Data collection and analysis For all-cause mortality, we calculated the log hazard ratio (HR) with standard error as point estimate and pooled them for meta-analysis using the inverse variance method. Sub-group analyses were performed regarding intervention regimen, trial truncation, or co-interventions. We validated the results with trial sequential analyses. We used random-effects model in all meta-analyses in anticipation of statistical heterogeneity among the trials. Main results We included nine trials with 645 participants. Six trials assessed TACE versus control and three trials assessed TAE versus control. Seven trials had low risk of selection bias based on adequate generation of allocation sequence and concealment - but all these trials had other risks of bias. Three trials were stopped early due to interim inspections and one due to slow accrual. For all-cause mortality, statistical heterogeneity between trials was low to moderate (I-2 = 30%). Meta-analysis of trials with low risk of selection bias showed that TACE or TAE versus control does not significantly increase survival (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.10). Two trials with low risk of selection bias, no early stopping, and no co-intervention did not establish any significant effect of TACE or TAE on overall survival (hazard ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.83; P = 0.33). Trial sequential analysis confirmed the absence of evidence for a beneficial effect of TACE or TAE on survival indicating the need for future randomisation of up to 383 additional participants. Substantial differences in criteria for assessing tumour response did not allow quantitative analyses. One trial investigated quality of life but did not detect any significant differences between the intervention groups.

Conflicts of interest (competing interests) and bias are ubiquitous. In medicine, they may have the potential to cause harm to patients or obstruct research and new treatments. Competing interests may arise from financial, academic or personal factors. Most interventions relate to managing competing financial interests derived from relationships with the pharmaceutical industry.

For many years, coordination chemists have effectively used small molecule models to understand these systems. More recently, protein design has been shown to be an effective approach for mimicking metal coordination environments. Since the first designed proteins were reported, much success has been seen for incorporating metal sites into proteins and attaining the desired coordination environment but until recently, this has been with a lack of significant catalytic activity. Now there are examples of designed metallo proteins that, although not yet reaching the activity of native enzymes, are considerably closer. In this review, we highlight work leading up to the design of a small metalloprotein containing two metal sites, one for structural stability (HgS3) and the other a separate catalytic zinc site to mimic carbonic anhydrase activity (ZnN3O). The first section will describe previous studies that allowed for a high affinity thiolate site that binds heavy metals in a way that stabilizes three-stranded coiled coils. The second section will examine ways of preparing histidine-rich environments that lead to metal-based hydrolytic catalysts. We will also discuss other recent examples of the design of structural metal sites and functional metalloenzymes. Our work demonstrates that attaining the proper first coordination geometry of a metal site can lead to a significant fraction of catalytic activity, apparently independent of the type of secondary structure of the surrounding protein environment. We are now in a position to begin to meet the challenge of building a metalloenzyme systematically from the bottom-up by engineering and analyzing interactions directly around the metal site and beyond.

It is known that Escherichia coli cells can be simultaneously transformed with multiple unique plasmids and thusly complicate recombinant library screening experiments. As a result of their potential to yield misleading results, bacterial multiple vector transformants have been thoroughly characterized in previous model studies. In contrast to bacterial systems, there is little quantitative information available regarding multiple vector transformants in yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most widely used eukaryotic platform for cell surface display, combinatorial protein engineering, and other recombinant library screens. In order to characterize the extent and nature of multiple vector transformants in this important host, plasmid-born gene libraries constructed by yeast homologous recombination were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Results: It was found that up to 90% of clones in yeast homologous recombination libraries may be multiple vector transformants, that on average these clones bear four or more unique mutant genes, and that these multiple vector cells persist as a significant proportion of library populations for greater than 24 hours during liquid outgrowth. Both vector concentration and vector to insert ratio influenced the library proportion of multiple vector transformants, but their population frequency was independent of transformation efficiency. Interestingly, the average number of plasmids born by multiple vector transformants did not vary with their library population proportion. Conclusion: These results highlight the potential for multiple vector transformants to dominate yeast libraries constructed by homologous recombination. The previously unrecognized prevalence and persistence of multiply transformed yeast cells have important implications for yeast library screens. The quantitative information described herein should increase awareness of this issue, and the rapid sequencing approach developed for these studies should be widely useful for identifying multiple vector transformants and avoiding complications associated with cells that have acquired more than one unique plasmid.",NA,NA,NA,"Griswold, Karl/B-3449-2012;","Griswold, Karl/0000-0002-9835-3394",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1472-6750",NA,NA,NA,NA,"20-Nov",2009,"9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"95","10.1186/1472-6750-9-95",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000272337200001",19930565,50,"50 no 6"

METHODS: Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and the normal liver cell line were infected with SG600-IL24 and Ad.IL-24. The mRNA and protein expression of MDA-7/IL-24 in infected cells was confirmed by RT-PCR, ELISA, and Western blotting. MTT assay was used to investigate the proliferation effect. Hoechst staining and Annexin-V and PI staining were performed to study the MDA-7/IL-24 gene expressed in HCC cell lines and the normal liver cell line. Flow cytometry was used to analyse the cell cycle. RESULTS: RT-PCR, ELISA and Western blotting confirmed that the exogenous MDA-7/IL-24 gene was highly expressed in cells infected with SG600-IL24. MTT and apoptosis detection indicated that SG600-IL24 induced growth suppression, promoted apoptosis, and blocked cancer cell lines in the G2/M phase in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines but not in the normal liver cell line.

In this study, we hypothesized that a combination of ZD55-IL-24-mediated gene virotherapy and chemotherapy using DTIC would produce an increased cytotoxicity against human melanoma cells in comparison with these agents alone. Our results showed that the combination of ZD55-IL-24 and DTIC significantly enhanced the anti-tumor activity by more effectively inducing apoptosis in melanoma cells than either agent used alone without any overlapping toxicity against normal cells. This additive or synergistic effect of ZD55-IL-24 in combination with DTIC in killing human malignant melanoma cells implies a promising novel approach for melanoma therapy.

Ad-ST13 also increases extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation levels, but the change is due to adenovirus replication. Overexpression of ST13 also increases the transcription activity of AP-1. Blocking ASK1-JNK pathway affects Ad-ST13-mediated colorectal cell apoptosis, decreases the release of cytochrome c in cytoplasm and caspase activation.

There is little scope for curiosity that played an important role in early Science. Results carrying negative implications are not easy to publish, and hypotheses have a tendency to take on the mantra of religious beliefs. Academic Science is facing on many fronts pressures that hardly existed in the past. Financial rewards apart from salary can be very high, in the form of fees for consultants, expert legal witnesses, patent development and even the establishment of private companies. Commercial funding forms a significant percentage of the Total Research Budgets in Science and Medicine, but this often leads to loss of control over research protocols and freedom to communicate the results. Media attention confers fame and prestige that is assiduously sought out by some individuals scientists, often supported by University resources, and Press Conferences prior to or synchronous with actual publication. Scientists have long been employed full-time by Government Departments, but research contracts are being increasingly offered by the latter to academic staff on a part-time basis. These pressures and opportunities, together with the priority given to research by most University Tenure and Promotion Committees, are tending to diminish the appetite of scientists for other important responsibilities such as teaching and administration. In a few decades, University scientists have moved from the ""Ivory Tower"" to the High Street, and many are serving more than one master. The above scenario may bring increased remuneration and the pursuit of research that would be too expensive without these external sources, but adverse consequences have also occurred. They may lead to the complicity of scientists, through no fault of their own, in the introduction of drugs and supplements that: a) fail to deliver the benefits claimed; b) increase the risk of some unrelated illness; c) possess dangerous side effects not known or reported at the time of introduction. Examples include hormone replacement therapy and antioxidant vitamins (A and E) to protect against Coronary Heart Disease; dietary fibre to prevent colon cancer; and arguably calcium supplements to treat osteoporosis. On occasions, academic scientists have served as fronts for the publication by the manufacturers of falsified reports minimizing the risk of serious drug side-effects to ensure Regulatory Approval, as occurred with Vioxx in the treatment of arthritis, and Seroquel for schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Individual fraud or misconduct is more frequent than suspected, because most incidents are without major impact and are suppressed by Universities and Funding Agencies. Major scandals are rare, but may have serious repercussions for the general public and bring science into disrepute. Recent examples include: the Cold Fusion controversy (Low Energy Nuclear Reaction); the linkage by Andrew Wakefield of autism with Rubella vaccination; the infamous creation of stem cells by somatic cell nuclear transfer falsely reported by Hwang Woo-Suk. Fraud by commercial companies is subject to the full force of the law, but Science is treated as a self-regulating profession, and as such the punishments handed out are relatively trivial. In essence, Science prior to 1950, except in North America, proceeded along a highway that segregated the traffic into Commercial, Government and Academic streams, and passed through inspiring landscapes and green pastures. It lter came to a crossroads from which the alternative road led to the Marketplace, and on which segregation into the above three streams was not enforced. It has now become the main thoroughfare for Science world-wide, but there are reasons to believe that this has increased the incidence of dangerous driving and traffic accidents in the form of conflicts of interest, unethical behaviour, misconduct and even fraud. It may be too late to return to the crossroads and continue along the original highway, but there could be considerable merit in restoring the original segregation between the three streams of Science and in developing, as well as enforcing, a stricter code of behaviour, for which some elements are proposed.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1452-8258",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2011,"30","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"79","92",NA,"10.2478/v10011-011-0004-8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000292081000001",NA,53,"53 no 3"

The present paper reports on a series of studies examining public attitudes to human cloning in the UK, bringing together a range of quantitative and qualitative methods to address this question. These included a nationally representative survey, an experimental vignette study, focus groups and analyses of media coverage. Overall the research presents a complex picture of attitude to and constructions of human cloning. In all of the analyses, therapeutic cloning was viewed more favourably than reproductive cloning. However, while participants in the focus groups were generally negative about both forms of cloning, and this was also reflected in the media analyses, quantitative results showed more positive responses. In the quantitative research, therapeutic cloning was generally accepted when the benefits of such procedures were clear, and although reproductive cloning was less accepted there was still substantial support. Participants in the focus groups only differentiated between therapeutic and reproductive cloning after the issue of therapeutic cloning was explicitly raised; initially they saw cloning as being reproductive cloning and saw no real benefits. Attitudes were shown to be associated with underlying values associated with scientific progress rather than with age, gender or education, and although there were a few differences in the quantitative data based on religious affiliation, these tended to be small effects. Likewise in the focus groups there was little direct appeal to religion, but the main themes were 'interfering with nature' and the 'status of the embryo', with the latter being used more effectively to try to close down further discussion. In general there was a close correspondence between the media analysis and focus group responses, possibly demonstrating the importance of media as a resource, or that the media reflect public discourse accurately. However, focus group responses did not simply reflect media coverage. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Genetic defects in NER cause human hereditary diseases including xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS), trichothiodystrophy and a combined XP/CS overlapping symptom. One key gene product associated with all these disorders is the excision repair cross-complementing 3/xeroderma pigmentosum B (ERCC3/XPB) DNA helicase, a subunit of the transcription factor IIH complex. ERCC3 is involved in initiation of basal transcription and global genome repair as well as in transcription-coupled repair (TCR).

We identified new mutations in the Chinese hamster ovary cell ERCC3 gene and characterized the role of hamster ERCC3 protein in DNA repair of ultraviolet (UV)-induced and oxidative DNA damage. All but one newly described mutations are located in the protein C-terminal region around the last intron-exon boundary.

Thus, despite the various locations of the mutations, their phenotypes are similar. All ercc3 mutants are extremely sensitive to UV-C light and lack recovery of RNA synthesis (RRS), confirming a defect in TCR of UV-induced damage.

We detected modest sensitivity of ercc3 mutants to the photosensitizer Ro19-8022, which primarily introduces 8-oxoguanine lesions into DNA.

Although the detailed mechanism of TCR is not yet understood, it is believed to be triggered when a translocating RNA polymerase is arrested at a lesion or unusual structure in the DNA. Conventional assays for TCR require high doses of DNA damage for the statistical analysis of repair in the individual strands of DNA sequences ranging in size from a few hundred bases to 30 kb. The single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay allows detection of single- or double-strand breaks at a 10-100-fold higher level of resolution. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with the Comet assay (Comet-FISH) affords a heightened level of sensitivity for the assessment of repair in defined DNA sequences of cells treated with physiologically relevant doses of genotoxins. This approach also reveals localized susceptibility to chromosomal breakage in cells from individuals with hypersensitivity to radiation or chemotherapy. Several groups have reported preferential repair in transcriptionally active genes or chromosomal domains using Comet-FISH. The prevailing interpretation of the behavior of DNA in the Comet assay assumes that the DNA is arranged in loops and matrix-attachment sites; that supercoiled, undamaged loops are contained within the nuclear matrix and appear in Comet ""heads"", and that Comet ""tails"" consist of relaxed DNA loops containing one or more breaks. According to this model, localization of FISH probes in Comet heads signifies that loops containing the targeted sequences are free of damage. This implies that preferential repair as detected by Comet-FISH might encompass large chromosomal domains containing both transcribed and non-transcribed sequences. We review the existing evidence and discuss the implications in relation to current models for the molecular mechanism of TCR. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that it is a highly complex process and requires the participation of the NER pathway, the RNA polymerase complex and additional factors. An early event in TCR is likely the blocking of RNA polymerase complex elongation by damage present in the transcribed strands of expressed genes. Whether TCR is involved in base excision repair pathways or the repair of common forms of oxidative damage is less clear. This review is focused on the description of possible mechanisms of TCR in E. coli and mammalian cells. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Both gene products function in the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), providing the cell with a mechanism to remove transcription-blocking lesions from the transcribed strands of actively transcribed genes. Besides a function in TCR of NER lesions, a role of CSB in (transcription-coupled) repair of oxidative DNA damage has been suggested. In this study we used mouse models to compare the effect of a CSA or a CSB defect on oxidative DNA damage sensitivity at the levels of the cell and the intact organism. In contrast to CSB-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), CSA(-/-) MEFs are not hypersensitive to gamma-ray or paraquat treatment. Similar results were obtained for keratinocytes. In contrast, both CSB-/- and CSA(-/-) embryonic stem cells show slight gamma-ray sensitivity. Finally, CSB-/- but not CSA(-/-) mice fed with food containing di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (causing elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage in the liver) show weight reduction. These findings not only uncover a clear difference in oxidative DNA damage sensitivity between CSA- and CSB-deficient cell lines and mice but also show that sensitivity to oxidative DNA damage is not a uniform characteristic of Cockayne syndrome. This difference in the DNA damage response between CSA- and CSB-deficient cells is unexpected, since until now no consistent differences between CSA and CSB patients have been reported.

Many statistical approaches can incorporate genotyping errors, but usually need accurate estimates of error rates. Here, we used a new microsatellite data set developed for brown rockfish (Sebastes auriculatus) to estimate genotyping error using three approaches: (i) repeat genotyping 5% of samples, (ii) comparing unintentionally recaptured individuals and (iii) Mendelian inheritance error checking for known parentoffspring pairs. In each data set, we quantified genotyping error rate per allele due to allele drop-out and false alleles. Genotyping error rate per locus revealed an average overall genotyping error rate by direct count of 0.3%, 1.5% and 1.7% (0.002, 0.007 and 0.008 per allele error rate) from replicate genotypes, known parentoffspring pairs and unintentionally recaptured individuals, respectively. By direct-count error estimates, the recapture and known parentoffspring data sets revealed an error rate four times greater than estimated using repeat genotypes. There was no evidence of correlation between error rates and locus variability for all three data sets, and errors appeared to occur randomly over loci in the repeat genotypes, but not in recaptures and parentoffspring comparisons. Furthermore, there was no correlation in locus-specific error rates between any two of the three data sets. Our data suggest that repeat genotyping may underestimate true error rates and may not estimate locus-specific error rates accurately.

Although inconsistencies were observed, particularly due to differences between migration of DNA fragments and actual allelic size ('size shifts'), inter-laboratory calibration was successful. Standardization also allowed an assessment of the degree and partitioning of genotyping error. Notably, the global allelic error rate was reduced from 0.05 +/- A 0.01 prior to calibration to 0.01 +/- A 0.002 post-calibration. Most errors were found to occur during analysis (i.e. when size-calling alleles; the mean proportion of all errors that were analytical errors across loci was 0.58 after calibration).

Previous studies have noted that ADO rates are greater with increasing allele size and in tetranucleotides. It has also been suggested, but not tested, that ADO rates may be higher in studies using cross-species microsatellites and that mutations may play a role in ADO rates. Here we examine the relationship between ADO rates and the relationship between evolutionary distance since divergence time between species for which the microsatellite was designed for and species on which it was used (divergence times), and how this may interact with median allele size. In addition, as the adenosine (A) and thymine (T) content of the primer may increase mutation rates, we also included total % AT content of the primer in the analyses. Finally, we examined whether other commonly associated causes of ADO (i.e. repeat motif length, median allele size and allele number) co-varied. We found that ADO rates were positively associated to divergence time and median allele size. Repeat motif length, median allele size and allele number positively covaried suggesting a link between mutability and these parameters. Results from previous studies that did not correct for co-variation among these parameters may have been confounded. AT content of the primer was positively associated with ADO rates. The best linear regression model contained divergence time, median allele size and total % AT content, explaining 21% of the variation in ADO rates. The available evidence suggests that mutations partly cause ADO and that studies using cross-species microsatellites may be at higher risk of ADO.

Despite this, little rigorous effort has been made to quantify the size of the problem and to identify the commonest sources of error. Here, we use a large data set comprising almost 2000 Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella genotyped at nine hypervariable microsatellite loci to explore error detection methods, common sources of error and the consequences of errors on paternal exclusion. We found good concordance among a range of contrasting approaches to error-rate estimation, our range being 0.0013 to 0.0074 per single locus PCR (polymerase chain reaction). The best approach probably involves blind repeat-genotyping, but this is also the most labour-intensive. We show that several other approaches are also effective at detecting errors, although the most convenient alternative, namely mother-offspring comparisons, yielded the lowest estimate of the error rate. In total, we found 75 errors, emphasizing their ubiquitous presence. The most common errors involved the misinterpretation of allele banding patterns (n = 60,80%) and of these, over a third (n = 22,36.7%) were due to confusion between homozygote and adjacent allele heterozygote genotypes. A specific test for whether a data set contains the expected number of adjacent allele heterozygotes could provide a useful tool with which workers can assess the likely size of the problem. Error rates are also positively correlated with both locus polymorphism and product size, again indicating aspects where extra effort at error reduction should be directed. Finally, we conducted simulations to explore the potential impact of genotyping errors on paternity exclusion. Error rates as low as 0.01 per allele resulted in a rate of false paternity exclusion exceeding 20%. Errors also led to reduced estimates of male reproductive skew and increases in the numbers of pups that matched more than one candidate male.

There has been debate over exactly what males are defending, whether mates, territory or both. One hypothesis holds that mates are defending mates, and that an increase in community range size will lead directly to the acquisition of more females. However, males frequently attack females as well as males at the edge of the community range. We examined 18 years of observational data on the Gombe chimpanzees to determine the behaviour of males during extragroup encounters, and the consequences of changes in community range size on the number of adult females and indirect measures of food availability. Males were always aggressive to males from other communities, and often attacked adult females, especially those that were not sexually receptive, were older, and/or had more than one offspring. The number of females did not increase with range size, but several measures suggested an increase in food availability with range size. These measures include more time spent in large foraging parties, higher encounter rates with resident females, more encounters with sexually receptive females and higher female reproductive rates. These findings suggest that males defend a feeding territory for their resident females and protect them from sexual harassment. Although a large range may eventually attract more females, this is not an immediate consequence of range expansion. Male number was not correlated with community range size.

This provides great potential to improve the accuracy of abundance estimates and determine behavioural parameters, such as home-range size, individual habitat and dietary preferences, and even some forms of social interaction. Non-invasive samples can also be a useful alternative to blood or tissue samples ( the collection of which traditionally has required trapping of animals) as genetic material for applications such as relatedness, population genetic and phylogenetic analyses. Despite the huge potential of non-invasive genetic sampling, the current technology does have limitations. The low quantity and quality of DNA often obtained from such sources results in an increased risk of genotyping errors, which may lead to incorrect inferences, particularly false identification of individuals.

Accumulating evidence suggests that airway disease in children is influenced by perinatal factors including perturbations in normal fetal lung development, postnatal interventions in the intensive care unit (ICU) and environmental and other insults in the neonatal period. Here, in addition to genetics, maternal health, environmental processes, innate immunity and impaired lung development/function can all influence pathogenesis of airway disease in children.

We determined whether the priming effect of intra-amniotic LPS amplifies hyperoxia-induced airway hyperreactivity (AHR). METHODS: LPS or normal saline was injected into the amniotic cavities of pregnant rats at the 20th day of gestation. After birth, rat pups were exposed to 60% O-2 or air for 14 d. On postnatal day 14, rat pups underwent forced oscillometry, which included a challenge with nebulized methacholine, and the lungs were harvested for morphological studies. RESULTS: Hyperoxia significantly increased airway reactivity and decreased compliance. Intra-amniotic LPS further increased hyperoxia-induced AHR but did not further impair respiratory system compliance. Hyperoxia-induced changes in lung parenchymal and small airway morphology were not further altered by intra-amniotic LPS. However, combined exposure to intra-amniotic LPS and hyperoxia increased the proportion of degranulating mast cells in the hilar airways. CONCLUSION: Intra-amniotic LPS amplified postnatal hyperoxia-induced AHR. This was associated with increased airway mast cell degranulation, which has previously been linked with hyperoxia-induced AHR.

Risk factors for BPD are complex and include prenatal infection and O-2 toxicity. BPD pathology is equally complex and characterized by inflammation and dysmorphic airspaces and vasculature. Due to the limited availability of clinical samples, an understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease and its causal mechanisms and associated biomarkers is limited. Objectives: Apply genome-wide expression profiling to define pathways affected in BPD lungs. Methods: Lung tissue was obtained at autopsy from 11 BPD cases and 17 age-matched control subjects without BPD. RNA isolated from these tissue samples was interrogated using microarrays. Standard gene selection and pathway analysis methods were applied to the data set. Abnormal expression patterns were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Measurements and Main Results: We identified 159 genes differentially expressed in BPD tissues. Pathway analysis indicated previously appreciated (e.g., DNA damage regulation of cell cycle) as well as novel (e.g., B-cell development) biological functions were affected. Three of the five most highly induced genes were mast cell (MC)-specific markers. We confirmed an increased accumulation of connective tissue MCTC (chymase expressing) mast cells in BPD tissues. Increased expression of MCTC markers was also demonstrated in an animal model of BPD-like pathology. Conclusions: We present a unique genome-wide expression data set from human BPD lung tissue. Our data provide information on gene expression patterns associated with BPD and facilitated the discovery that MCTC accumulation is a prominent feature of this disease.

RPE cell structure and function are well understood, the cells are readily sustainable in laboratory culture and, unlike other cell types within the retina, RPE cells do not require synaptic connections to perform their role. These factors, together with the relative ease of outer retinal imaging, make RPE cells an attractive target for cell transplantation compared with other cell types in the retina or central nervous system. Seminal experiments in rats with an inherited RPE dystrophy have demonstrated that RPE transplantation can prevent photoreceptor loss and maintain visual function. This review provides an update on the progress made so far on RPE transplantation in human eyes, outlines potential sources of donor cells, and describes the technical and surgical challenges faced by the transplanting surgeon.

Multipotent stem cells, like hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), can develop into multiple specialized cells in a specific tissue. Unipotent cells differentiate only into one cell type, like e.g. satellite cells of skeletal muscle. There are many examples of successful clinical applications of stem cells. Over million patients worldwide have benefited from bone marrow transplantations performed for treatment of leukemias, anemias or immunodeficiencies. Skin stem cells are used to heal severe burns, while limbal stem cells can regenerate the damaged cornea. Pluripotent stem cells, especially the patient-specific iPSC, have a tremendous therapeutic potential, but their clinical application will require overcoming numerous drawbacks. Therefore, the use of adult stem cells, which are multipotent or unipotent, can be at present a more achievable strategy. Noteworthy, some studies ascribed particular adult stem cells as pluripotent. However, despite efforts, the postulated pluripotency of such events like ""spore-like cells"", ""very small embryonic-like stem cells"" or ""multipotent adult progenitor cells"" have not been confirmed in stringent independent studies.

Objectives The present Cochrane Review compares tandem autologous stem cell transplantation (TASCT) with single autologous stem cell transplantation (SASCT) as first-line treatment in patients with symptomatic MM with respect to overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), quality of life (QoL) and treatment-or transplantation-related mortality. Search methods We systematically identified controlled trials published between January 1995 and May 2011 in two bibliographic databases (MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and in clinical trial registries. Selection criteria One researcher screened references for controlled trials to determine eligibility for the systematic review (SR) according to pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, reflecting characteristics of disease and the interventions. We required a minimal set of details to be reported for observational studies for the studies to be included. Data collection and analysis We critically evaluated eligible trials with respect to quality of design and actual performance. One researcher extracted individual trial results, which were checked by another researcher. We recapitulated the results of the individual trials in a standardised way for the SR in order to allow a systematic assessment of potential sources of bias. Main results Overall, we identified 14 controlled studies. One registered randomised controlled trial (RCT) is still recruiting patients at the time of this review and no clinical results have been published. Two registered RCTs have remained unpublished despite their termination. Publications on one RCT had been retracted. We excluded five observational studies since neither patients nor treatment regimens were sufficiently characterised to allow an assessment of potential confounding by indication. We conducted a SR of study designs, definition of endpoints, treatment regimens and baseline characteristics of patients in the five included RCTs (two full-text publications, three conference presentations) enrolling1506 patients in total. Because we identified substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we refrained from conducting a formal meta-analysis. While we included only previously untreated, symptomatic patients with MM the treatment regimens differed notably with respect to acute toxicity, between trials and also between study arms. Compared to state of the art treatment standards, the treatment regimens applied in all trials have to be considered as below standard from a contemporary perspective in at least one component. Three trials were likely to have the potential of being highly biased while two RCTs had a moderate potential for bias. The observed treatment effects in the set of included trials may have been influenced by a steep decrease in compliance with the second ASCT and the concomitant selection of patients. In addition, OS data were confounded by the treatment subsequent to first-line therapy. OS was statistically significantly improved in one trial only. While EFS was prolonged in four of the five trials, the median prolongation ranged between three to 12 months, with an uncertain direction of bias in the individual trials. QoL was not reported in any study. Results concerning treatment-or transplantation-related mortality could not be adequately assessed due to substantial differences in definitions between trials and low reporting quality. Authors' conclusions We did not consider any study to be sufficiently informative for contemporary treatment decisions concerning the question single versus tandem ASCT in view of inherent biases. In addition, none of the trials integrated the so-called ""novel agents"" which are now considered standard treatment for MM. To improve the quality of future studies, sample size calculations should consider the potentially steep decrease in compliance with the second ASCT. Reporting of results of treatment-or transplantation-related mortality should clearly specify the type and number of events (the numerator) in a well-defined population (the denominator).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1469-493X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2012,NA,"10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CD004626","10.1002/14651858.CD004626.pub3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000310016900004",NA,62,"62 no 3"

However, none of them is able to monitor miRNA levels expressed in living cancer cells in a real-time fashion. Some fluorescennt biosensors developed recently from carbon nanomaterials, such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), graphene oxide (GO), and carbon nanoparticles, have been successfully used for assaying miRNA in vitro; however the preparation processes are often expensive, complicated and time-consuming, which have motivated the research on other substitute and novel materials.

The NMOF works as a fluorescence quencher of the labelled PNA that is firmly bound with the metal center.

However ZnO2 show paramagnetic behaviour, whereas graphene exhibits very low magnetic intensity (0.0004 emu g(-1)). To enhance magnetization, graphene was treated with 3-mercatopropionic acid followed by coating with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped ZnO2 nanoparticles. Interestingly coating of graphene over ZnO2 does not enhance magnetization, whereas coating of 15-20% ZnO2 nanoparticles over graphene enhances magnetization more than 30 times, which gradually decreases on increasing concentration of ZnO2 nanoparticles. Such coated graphene shows highest saturation of magnetization at room temperature ever reported in graphene (130 memu g(-1)). The Magnetic measurements studies of ZnO2 nanoparticles coated graphene indicates excellent room temperature ferromagnetic behaviour, which has been further confirmed by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and Magnetic Force Microscopy studies. A comparative study was also done with ZnO nanoparticles with graphene and only 60 memu g(-1) magnetization has been observed.

The role of growth conditions, codoping by shallow impurities, kinetic barriers, and surface reactions in controlling the aggregation of magnetic cations is highlighted.

It is shown that in all these cases above the JTE are ""hidden"" in the excited states of the undistorted configuration even when the energy gap to these states is very large, and the involvement of these states in the vibronic coupling explains the JT origin of the distortions. This confirms the general validity of the HE as the only source of instabilities and distortions of high-symmetry configurations of polyatomic systems. For the example of the ozone molecule, which has no degenerate ground state, neither in the distorted (obtuse-triangular), nor in the undistorted (regular triangular) configurations, and there are no low-lying excited states, the distortion is shown to emerge from the HE in the excited E state situated at similar to 8.3 eV above the ground state. The JT stabilization energy is more than similar to 9 eV which makes the distorted configuration the lowest in energy. For molecular systems with half-closed-shell electronic configurations e(2) and t(3) (with degenerate orbitals), which produce totally symmetric charge distribution and are not subject to the JTE (neither in the ground high-spin (HS) state, nor in the excited low-spin (LS) states formed from these configurations by interelectron interaction), distortions were shown to occur due to a strong PJT mixing of two excited states. Again, the PIT stabilization energy in these cases is larger than the energy gap to the ground state, so the low-spin excited state of the undistorted geometry becomes the lowest in energy in the distorted configuration, and it is shown that this distortion is accompanied by orbital disproportionation that makes the charge distribution lower in symmetry. Since the two spin-states are stable in two different nuclear configurations, distorted (LS) and undistorted (HS), a novel phenomenon emerges in these systems: JT-induced spin-crossover. Distinguished from the known spin-crossover in transition metal compounds, the JT-induced spin-crossover takes place in a large variety of molecular systems from different classes including organic compounds, and it has a much lower rate of relaxation between the two states; this makes them candidates for single-molecule materials for electronic devices.

Zero-field cooled (ZFC) susceptibility measurements also display very complex behavior with a susceptibility maximum that strongly varies in temperature from sample to sample. Low-temperature magnetization curves indicate a saturation magnetization M-S approximate to 0.35 emu/g at 2 K and can be well fitted with a classical Langevin function. M-S is more than an order of magnitude larger than any possible iron impurity, proving that the observed magnetic phenomena are an intrinsic effect of the carbon nanofoam.

In order to develop prion models incorporating a genetically tractable simple system with a well-defined neuronal system, we generated transgenic C. elegans expressing the mouse PrP behind the pan-neuronal ric-19 promoter (P(ric-19)).

Supplementation of antioxidants has been advocated to decrease cellular oxidative stress and potentially extend lifespan. A genetically modified K6001 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was employed to determine the effect of several antioxidants, including D-erythroascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol and coenzyme Q(10) on yeast cell replicative ageing. The replicative lifespan of the K6001 strain was assessed by absorbance change as cells exhibited a linear growth in glucose medium. In this study, water-soluble D-erythroascorbic acid had little effect on cell replicative lifespan. However, supplementation of the growth medium with the lipophilic antioxidants alpha-tocopherol increased oxidative stress and decreased cell lifespan. The use of alpha-tocopherol analogues revealed that the antioxidant activity and the membrane retention ability of alpha-tocopherol were involved in the lifespan reduction effect. Supplementation with either coenzyme Q(10) alone, or in combination with alpha-tocopherol also led to a reduction in yeast replicative lifespan.

Two K-Ras mRNAs are obtained from the same pre-mRNA by alternative splicing. H-Ras pre-mRNA can also be alternatively spliced in the IDX and 4A terminal exons, yielding the p19 and p21 proteins, respectively. However, despite the Ras gene family's established role in tumorigenic cellular signal transduction events, little is known about p19 function. Previous results showed that p19 did not interact with two known p21 effectors, Raf1 and Rini, but was shown to interact with RACK1, a scaffolding protein that promotes multi-protein complexes in different signaling pathways (Cancer Res 2003, 63 p5178). This observation suggests that p19 and p21 play differential and complementary roles in the cell. Principal Findings: We found that p19 regulates telomerase activity through its interaction with p73a./I3 proteins. We also found that p19 overexpression induces G1/S phase delay; an observation that correlates with hypophosphorylation of both Akt and p7OSK6. Similarly, we also observed that FOX01 is upregulated when p19 is overexpressed. The three observations of (1) hypophosphorylation of Akt, (2) G1/S phase delay and (3) upregulation of FOX01 lead us to conclude that p19 induces G1/S phase delay, thereby maintaining cells in a reversible quiescence state and preventing entry into apoptosis. We then assessed the effect of p19 RNAi on HeLa cell growth and found that p19 RNAi increases cell growth, thereby having the opposite effect of arrest of the G1/S phase or producing a cellular quiescence state. Significance:Interestingly, p19 induces FOX01 that in combination with the G1/S phase delay and hypophosphorylation of both Akt and p7OSK6 leads to maintenance of a reversible cellular quiescence state, thereby preventing entry into apoptosis.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203",NA,NA,NA,NA,"30-Dec",2009,"4","12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"e8513","10.1371/journal.pone.0008513",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000278068700024",20046837,66,"66 no 3"

A retrospective study of conventional dysplasia grading was conducted on 1,401 patients. DNA ploidy analysis was conducted on a subset of 273 patients and results correlated with clinical information, pathologic diagnosis, and outcome over 5 to 15 years. Malignant transformation occurred in 32 of 273 patients (12%) and, of these, 20 (63%) of preexisting index lesions were aneuploid. Of 241 patients not developing carcinoma, only 39 (16%) of index lesions were aneuploid. Epithelial dysplasia correlated with DNA ploidy status (P < 0.001). The overall positive predictive value for malignant transformation by DNA aneuploidy was 38.5% (sensitivity 65.2% and specificity 75%) and by severe dysplasia grade 39.5% (sensitivity 30% and specificity 98%). DNA diploid and tetraploid status had negative predictive value of 90% to 96%. Combining DNA ploidy analysis with dysplasia grading gives a higher predictive value than either technique alone. Each of three traditional dysplasia grades predicts a significantly different risk of carcinoma development and time to transformation.

This study examined the development of carcinoma from oral dysplastic lesions, and the association between abnormal DNA content and progression to carcinoma. METHODS: Epithelial dysplasias from the Oral Pathology Diagnostic Service were matched against the Ontario Cancer Registry database to identify cases that progressed to carcinoma. A case-control study was conducted to compare DNA image cytometry of dysplasias that progressed with those that have not progressed. For a subset of the progressed dysplasias, DNA content of the carcinoma was also analysed. RESULTS: A total of 8% of epithelial dysplasias progressed to carcinoma after 6-131 months. In all, 28 of 99 dysplasias showed abnormal DNA content by image cytometry. In multivariate analysis of time to progression, abnormal DNA content was a significant predictor with hazard ratio of 3.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.5-7.4) corrected for site and grade of dysplasia. Analysis of sequential samples of dysplasia and carcinoma suggested that epithelial cell populations with grossly abnormal DNA content were transient intermediates during oral cancer development.

It is known that Escherichia coli cells can be simultaneously transformed with multiple unique plasmids and thusly complicate recombinant library screening experiments. As a result of their potential to yield misleading results, bacterial multiple vector transformants have been thoroughly characterized in previous model studies. In contrast to bacterial systems, there is little quantitative information available regarding multiple vector transformants in yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most widely used eukaryotic platform for cell surface display, combinatorial protein engineering, and other recombinant library screens. In order to characterize the extent and nature of multiple vector transformants in this important host, plasmid-born gene libraries constructed by yeast homologous recombination were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Results: It was found that up to 90% of clones in yeast homologous recombination libraries may be multiple vector transformants, that on average these clones bear four or more unique mutant genes, and that these multiple vector cells persist as a significant proportion of library populations for greater than 24 hours during liquid outgrowth. Both vector concentration and vector to insert ratio influenced the library proportion of multiple vector transformants, but their population frequency was independent of transformation efficiency. Interestingly, the average number of plasmids born by multiple vector transformants did not vary with their library population proportion. Conclusion: These results highlight the potential for multiple vector transformants to dominate yeast libraries constructed by homologous recombination. The previously unrecognized prevalence and persistence of multiply transformed yeast cells have important implications for yeast library screens. The quantitative information described herein should increase awareness of this issue, and the rapid sequencing approach developed for these studies should be widely useful for identifying multiple vector transformants and avoiding complications associated with cells that have acquired more than one unique plasmid.",NA,NA,NA,"Griswold, Karl/B-3449-2012;","Griswold, Karl/0000-0002-9835-3394",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1472-6750",NA,NA,NA,NA,"20-Nov",2009,"9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"95","10.1186/1472-6750-9-95",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000272337200001",19930565,78,"78 no 1"

We find that plasmids are not rapidly lost, but are able to persist in bacteria for multiple overnight growth cycles, with some dependence upon the nature of the antibiotic selected for. By carrying out the experiments with different origins of replication, we have been able to show that higher copy number leads to longer persistence, but even with low copy plasmids, persistence occurs to a significant degree.

Patients and methods: A total of 759 consecutive ERCP procedures were performed in 704 patients from January 2005 through December 2010 at the Endoscopy Unit of Central Hospital, Tripoli, Libya. The patients' demographic characteristics, clinical information, ERCP indications, laboratory parameters, and post-ERCP complications were reviewed. Formal written consent was obtained from all patients prior to each procedure. Results: The study included 280 (36.9%) males and 479 (63.1%) females with mean age +/- standard deviation (SD) of 56.8 +/- 18.7 years. Papillotomy was performed in 670 (88.3%) cases of the ERCP procedures. Common bile duct (CBD) stones were reported in 389 (51.3%) cases and were more frequent in females (234 cases, 60.1%) than males (155, 39.9%) (p = 0.01). The majority of the CBD stones were successfully retrieved with balloon extraction (304 cases, 78.2%), while mechanical lithotripsy (67 cases, 17.2%) and Dormia basket (11 cases, 2.8%) were used for difficult stones. Only seven (1.8%) cases were referred for surgery. Malignancy was found in 151 (19.9%) of the cases and was significantly more common in males than females (102, 67.5% vs. 49, 32.5%, respectively, p = 0.001). Stents for bile drainage were inserted in 26 (17.2%) of these cases. The complications encountered were acute pancreatitis in 30 cases (3.9%), minor bleeding in nine cases (1.2%), major bleeding in one case (0.15%), cholangitis in four cases (0.52%), and perforation in one case (0.15). Mortality was reported in three cases (0.4%). Conclusion: The ERCP indications and the related complications, in our centre in Libya, are comparatively consistent with those reported data in other countries. Successful biliary cannulation was achieved in most of the patients, and post-ERCP complications were uncommon except for pancreatitis, which occurred more frequently.

Treatment of EFR and EFR:: XA21 rice leaf tissue with elf18 leads to MAP kinase activation, reactive oxygen production and defense gene expression. Although expression of EFR does not lead to robust enhanced resistance to fully virulent Xoo isolates, it does lead to quantitatively enhanced resistance to weakly virulent Xoo isolates. EFR interacts with OsSERK2 and the XA21 binding protein 24 (XB24), two key components of the rice XA21-mediated immune response. Rice-EFR plants silenced for OsSERK2, or overexpressing rice XB24 are compromised in elf18-induced reactive oxygen production and defense gene expression indicating that these proteins are also important for EFR-mediated signaling in transgenic rice.

The mathematical model incorporates tangential viscous stresses and bending elastic forces, together with the inextensibility constraint and the enclosed volume constraint. The membrane is discretized by a surface mesh made up of planar triangles, over which a mixed formulation (velocity-curvature) is built based on the viscous bilinear form (Boussinesq-Scriven operator) and the Laplace-Beltrami identity relating position and curvature. A semi-implicit approach is then used to discretize in time, with piecewise linear interpolants for all variables. Two stabilization terms are needed: The first one stabilizes the inextensibility constraint by a pressure-gradient-projection scheme (Codina and Blasco (1997) [33]), the second couples curvature and velocity to improve temporal stability, as proposed by Bansch (2001) [36]. The volume constraint is handled by a Lagrange multiplier (which turns out to be the internal pressure), and an analogous strategy is used to filter out rigid-body motions. The nodal positions are updated in a Lagrangian manner according to the velocity solution at each time step. An automatic remeshing strategy maintains suitable refinement and mesh quality throughout the simulation. Numerical experiments show the convergent and robust behavior of the proposed method. Stability limits are obtained from numerous relaxation tests, and convergence with mesh refinement is confirmed both in the relaxation transient and in the final equilibrium shape. Virtual tweezing experiments are also reported, computing the dependence of the deformed membrane shape with the tweezing velocity (a purely dynamical effect). For sufficiently high velocities, a tether develops which shows good agreement, both in its final radius and in its transient behavior, with available analytical solutions. Finally, simulation results of a membrane subject to the simultaneous action of six tweezers illustrate the robustness of the method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Probe mobility is assisted by the lateral fluidity, which is thought to be purely viscous for lipid bilayers and synthetic systems such as polymersomes. In previous theoretical studies, the hydrodynamical mobility is estimated assuming a fixed membrane geometry. However, fluid membranes are very flexible out-of-plane. By accounting for the deformability of the membrane and in the presence of curvature, we show that the lateral motion of an inclusion produces a normal force, which results in a nonuniform membrane deformation. Such a deformation mobilizes the bending elasticity, produces extra lateral viscous and elastic forces, and results in an effective lateral viscoelastic behavior. The coupling between lateral and out-of-plane mechanics is mediated by the interfacial hydrodynamics and curvature. We analyze the frequency and curvature dependent rheology of flexible fluid membranes, and interpret it with a simple four-element model, which provides a background for microrheological experiments.

Many inflammatory lung diseases are characterized with a massive influx of neutrophils into the airways. Neutrophils contribute to the pathology of these diseases. To date, NETs have been identified in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF), acute lung injury (ALI), allergic asthma, and lungs infected with bacteria, virus, or fungi. These microbes and several host factors can stimulate NET formation, or NETosis. Different forms of NETosis have been identified and are dependent on varying types of stimuli. All of these pathways however appear to result in the formation of NETs that contain DNA, modified extracellular histones, proteases, and cytotoxic enzymes. Some of the NET components are immunogenic and damaging to host tissue. Innate immune collectins, such as pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D), bind NETs, and enhance the clearance of dying cells and DNA by alveolar macrophages. In many inflammatory lung diseases, bronchoalveolar SP-D levels are altered and its deficiency results in the accumulation of DNA in the lungs. Some of the other therapeutic molecules under consideration for treating NET-related diseases include DNases, antiproteases, myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitors, peptidylarginine deiminase-4 inhibitors, and anti-historic antibodies.

Patients with chronic granulomatous disease, an inherited disorder of NADPH oxidase in which phagocytes are defective in generation of reactive oxidant intermediates (ROIs), suffer from life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. The mechanisms by which NADPH oxidase mediate host defense are unclear. In addition to ROI generation, neutrophil NADPH oxidase activation is linked to the release of sequestered proteases that are posited to be critical effectors of host defense. To definitively determine the contribution of NADPH oxidase versus neutrophil serine proteases, we evaluated susceptibility to fungal and bacterial infection in mice with engineered disruptions of these pathways. NADPH oxidase-deficient mice (p47(phox-/-)) were highly susceptible to pulmonary infection with Aspergillus fumigatus. In contrast, double knockout neutrophil elastase (NE)(-/-) x cathepsin G (CG)(-/-) mice and lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin C/dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI)-deficient mice that are defective in neutrophil serine protease activation demonstrated no impairment in antifungal host defense. In separate studies of systemic Burkholderia cepacia infection, uniform fatality occurred in p47(phox-/-) mice, whereas NE(-/-) x CG(-/-) mice cleared infection. Together, these results show a critical role for NADPH oxidase in antimicrobial host defense against A. fumigatus and B. cepacia, whereas the proteases we evaluated were dispensable.

By utilizing high-throughput sequencing technologies, the biological function of RNA-editing has been actively investigated. Currently, RNA-editing is considered to be a key regulator that controls various cellular functions, such as protein activity, alternative splicing pattern of mRNA, and substitution of miRNA targeting site. DARNED, a public RDD database, reported that there are more than 300-thousands RNA-editing sites detected in human genome(hg19). Moreover, multiple studies suggested that RNA-editing events occur in highly specific conditions. According to DARNED, 97.62 % of registered editing sites were detected in a single tissue or in a specific condition, which also supports that the RNA-editing events occur condition-specifically. Since RNA-seq can capture the whole landscape of transcriptome, RNA-seq is widely used for RDD prediction. However, significant amounts of false positives or artefacts can be generated when detecting RNA-editing from RNA-seq. Since it is difficult to perform experimental validation at the whole-transcriptome scale, there should be a powerful computational tool to distinguish true RNA-editing events from artefacts. Result: We developed RDDpred, a Random Forest RDD classifier. RDDpred reports potentially true RNA-editing events from RNA-seq data. RDDpred was tested with two publicly available RNA-editing datasets and successfully reproduced RDDs reported in the two studies (90 %, 95 %) while rejecting false-discoveries (NPV: 75 %, 84 %). Conclusion: RDDpred automatically compiles condition-specific training examples without experimental validations and then construct a RDD classifier. As far as we know, RDDpred is the very first machine-learning based automated pipeline for RDD prediction.

We further confirmed the role of SLP-76 in HIV-1 infection by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown in MT4 cells and PBMCs. Structural-functional analysis revealed that the N-terminal domain of SLP-76 was important for regulating HIV-1 infection. Further mechanistic studies revealed that lack of SLP-76 impaired virus release, but did not affect viral entry, integration, and transcription. We also showed that SLP-76 plays a critical role in cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1. Signaling studies revealed that SLP-76 associated with viral negative regulatory factor protein and multiple signaling molecules during HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, SLP-76 facilitated the association of negative regulatory factor and F-actin, suggesting that SLP-76 mediates the formation of a signaling complex that may regulate viral release via cytoskeletal changes. Taken together, our studies demonstrate a novel role for the adaptor molecule SLP-76 in regulating HIV-1 infection in T cells with the potential to develop innovative strategies against HIV-1.

An indirect intracellular staining (ICS) method was optimized using antibodies designed for other applications like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), confocal imaging, and western blotting. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) value - a measure for the protein expression level - increased upon higher antibody concentration and longer incubation time, and was reduced following preincubation with recombinant proteins. Staining of stably transfected or knock-down cell lines supported the method's specificity. Moreover, confocal microscopy analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), when stained according to the ICS method, confirmed the localization of APOBEC3G and TRIM5 alpha in the cytoplasm, and of LEDGF/p75 in the nucleus. Also, stimulation with mitogen, interferon-alpha, or interferon-beta resulted in detectable, albeit weak, increases in intracellular expression of APOBEC3G and TRIM5 alpha. After optimization, the method was applied to healthy control and HIV-1 infected subjects. For all subjects studied, the memory subset of CD4+ T cells showed significantly higher expression levels of APOBEC3G, TRIM5 alpha, and LEDGF/p75, while the CD16+ subset of monocytes was characterized by higher expression levels of LEDGF/p75. In addition, we observed that therapy-nave HIV-1 patients tended to have lower expression levels of APOBEC3G and TRIM5 alpha than HIV-1 negative controls. In summary, our data provide proof-of-principle for the detection of specific host factors at the level of a single cell, which may prove useful for our further understanding of their role in virus-host interactions.

Central statistical monitoring (CSM) is a cheaper alternative, where data checks are performed by the coordinating centre, avoiding the need to visit all sites. Several publications have suggested methods for CSM; however, few have described their use in real trials. Methods R-programs were created to check data at either the subject level (7 tests within 3 programs) or site level (9 tests within 8 programs) using previously described methods or new ones we developed. These aimed to find possible data errors such as outliers, incorrect dates, or anomalous data patterns; digit preference, values too close or too far from the means, unusual correlation structures, extreme variances which may indicate fraud or procedural errors and under-reporting of adverse events. The methods were applied to three trials, one of which had closed and has been published, one in follow-up, and a third to which fabricated data were added. We examined how well the methods work, discussing their strengths and limitations. Results The R-programs produced simple tables or easy-to-read figures. Few data errors were found in the first two trials, and those added to the third were easily detected. The programs were able to identify patients with outliers based on single or multiple variables. They also detected (1) fabricated patients, generated to have values too close to the multivariate mean, or with too low variances in repeated measurements, and (2) sites which had unusual correlation structures or too few adverse events. Some methods were unreliable if applied to centres with few patients or if data were fabricated in a way which did not fit the assumptions used to create the programs. Outputs from the R-programs are interpreted using examples. Limitations Detecting data errors is relatively straightforward; however, there are several limitations in the detection of fraud: some programs cannot be applied to small trials or to centres with few patients (<10) and data falsified in a manner which does not fit the program's assumptions may not be detected. In addition, many tests require a visual assessment of the output (showing flagged participants or sites), before data queries are made or on-site visits performed. Conclusions CSM is a worthwhile alternative to on-site data checking and may be used to limit the number of site visits by targeting only sites which are picked up by the programs.

Recent studies have provided new insight into the molecular structure and functional features of FXI and have demonstrated distinct structural and biological differences between activated factor XII (FXIIa)-mediated FXI activation and tissue factor/thrombin-mediated FXI activation. The former is important in thrombosis; the latter is more essential in hemostasis. Activated partial thromboplastin tine (aPTT) artificially reflects FXIIa-initiated intrinsic coagulation pathway in vitro. Conversely, FXIIa-inhibited diluted thromboplastin time assay may reflect tissue factor/thrombin-mediated FXI activation in vivo. Further explication of the genetic mutations of FXI deficiency has improved the understanding of the structure-function relationship of FXI. Besides its procoagulant activity, the antifibrinolytic activity of FXI was well documented in a wealth of literature. Finally, the new emerging concept of inhibiting FXI as a novel antithrombotic approach with an improved benefit-risk ratio has been supported through observations from human FXI deficiency and various animal models. Large-and small-molecule FXI inhibitors have shown promising antithrombotic effects.

However, many alternative mRNA isoforms carry premature termination codons (PTCs) rendering them possible targets for the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. The F11 gene consists of 15 exons spanning approximately 23 kb on chromosome 4q35 and codes for coagulation factor XI (FXI), a 160-kDa dimeric zymogen composed of 4 apple domains and a serine protease domain. Here, we characterized the F11 splicing pattern in human liver and platelets identifying multiple in-frame and out-of-frame splicing events. Inhibition of NMD resulted in the up-regulation of all unproductively spliced F11 transcripts, thus providing evidence that these PTC-containing mRNAs are under the control of NMD. Among in-frame alternatively spliced transcripts, the one skipping exons 6 and 7 would lead to the synthesis of a FXI protein lacking 1 apple domain (FXI-Delta 6/7). Ex vivo expression in mammalian cells demonstrated that FXI-Delta 6/7 is mostly retained intracellularly, and secreted only in low amounts. Traces of this FXI isoform were detectable in human plasma. Our results suggest that the coupling of alternative splicing and NMD may play a role in regulating F11 expression, and point to the existence of a novel FXI isoform.

However, the underlying mechanisms involved in patterning the cleavage-stage embryo are still unresolved. By analyzing the distribution of the transcription factors Oct4 (Pou5f1), Cdx2 and Nanog at precisely defined stages in pre-implantation development, we were able to identify critical events leading to the divergence of TE, EPI and PE lineages. We found that Oct4 is present in all cells until late blastocyst, gradually disappearing from the TE thereafter. The expression patterns of both Cdx2 and Nanog exhibit two specific phases, culminating in their restriction to TE and EPI, respectively. In the first phase, starting after compaction, blastomeres show highly variable Cdx2 and Nanog protein levels. Importantly, the variability in Nanog levels is independent of position within the morula, whereas Cdx2 variability may originate from asymmetric cell divisions at the 8-cell stage in a non-stereotypic way. Furthermore, there is initially no reciprocal relationship between Cdx2 and Oct4 or between Cdx2 and Nanog protein levels. In the second phase, a definite pattern is established, possibly by a sorting process that accommodates intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Based on these results, we propose a model in which early embryonic mouse patterning includes stochastic processes, consistent with the highly regulative capacity of the embryo.

Methods: We used the Illumina GoldenGate Cancer Methylation Panel to compare DNA methylation in the three main histologic subtypes of pediatric GCTs (germinoma, teratoma and yolk sac tumor (YST); N = 51) and used recursively partitioned mixture models (RPMM) to test associations between methylation pattern and tumor and demographic characteristics. We identified genes and pathways that were differentially methylated using generalized linear models and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. We also measured global DNA methylation at LINE1 elements and evaluated methylation at selected imprinted loci using pyrosequencing. Results: Methylation patterns differed by tumor histology, with 18/19 YSTs forming a distinct methylation class. Four pathways showed significant enrichment for YSTs, including a human embryonic stem cell pluripotency pathway. We identified 190 CpG loci with significant methylation differences in mature and immature teratomas (q < 0.05), including a number of CpGs in stem cell and pluripotency-related pathways. Both YST and germinoma showed significantly lower methylation at LINE1 elements compared with normal adjacent tissue while there was no difference between teratoma (mature and immature) and normal tissue. DNA methylation at imprinted loci differed significantly by tumor histology and location. Conclusion: Understanding methylation patterns may identify the developmental stage at which the GCT arose and the at-risk period when environmental exposures could be most harmful.

Therefore, cellular differentiation is a natural consequence of the fact that DNA strands are complementary and nonequivalent. Another epigenetic control that ""silences"" library copies of mat-information is due to heterochromatin organization. This is a clear case where Mendel's gene is composed of DNA plus the associated epigenetic moiety.

We found that i.n. delivery of flagellin elicits a transient change in respiratory function and an acute, pro-inflammatory response in the lungs, characterized by TLR5- and MyD88-dependent chemokine secretion and neutrophil recruitment. In contrast, TLR4, CD14 and TRIF were not essential for flagellin-mediated responses, indicating that TLR4 does not cooperate with TLR5 in the lungs. Respiratory function, chemokine secretion and airway infiltration by neutrophils were dependent on radioresistant, TLR5-expressing cells. Furthermore, lung haematopoietic cells also responded to flagellin by activating TNF-alpha production. We suggest that the radioresistant lung epithelial cells are essential for initiating early, TLR5-dependent signalling in response to flagellin and thus triggering the lung's innate immune responses.",NA,NA,NA,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009; Hussell, Tracy/O-4630-2014; SIRARD, Jean-Claude/B-5932-2011","Hussell, Tracy/0000-0001-7186-6141; SIRARD, Jean-Claude/0000-0001-9854-4652",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0014-2980",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2009,"39","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1587","1596",NA,"10.1002/eji.200838907",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000267481400016",19424969,97,"97 no 1"

TLR4 also interacts with CD14, which upon complex formation triggers TLR4-associated signaling pathways to produce a proinflammatory response. This mechanism results in the activation of NF-kappaB and subsequent inflammatory gene induction. In order to determine the effect of combustion source particle matter (PM), rich in zinc and nickel but with negligible endotoxin, on a possible activation of TLR4-mediated cell signaling and inflammation, we intratracheally (IT) instilled 3.3 mg/kg of PM into 12-w-old healthy male Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and susceptible spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. Inflammation, inflammatory-mediator gene expression, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein and LDH, TLR4 and CD14 protein, and NF-kappaB activation in the lung were determined after 24 h. Dose-response data (0.0, 0.83, 3.33, and 8.3 mg/kg PM) for BALF LDH were obtained as a marker of lung cell injury in SH rats. BALF neutrophils, but not macrophages, were significantly increased in the PM-exposed WKY and SH rats. SH rats showed a greater PMN increase than WKY rats. Similarly, BALF protein and LDH levels were also increased following PM exposure but to a significantly greater extent in SH rats. Plasma fibrinogen was increased only in SH rats exposed to PM. The increased inflammation seen in PM-exposed SH rats was accompanied by a significant increase in TLR4 protein in the lung tissue, which was primarily localized in alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells. CD14 was also increased by PM exposure in both SH and WKY rats but was significantly greater in the SH rats. These increases were associated with greater translocation of NF-kappaB in the lungs of SH rather than WKY rats. This was accompanied by increased macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP)-2 mRNA expression at 24 h of exposure. These data suggest that the increased inflammation in the lungs of PM-exposed SH rats compared to WKY rats is accompanied by an increase in TLR4-mediated cell signaling. Thus, one of the mechanisms for greater susceptibility of SH rats to PM exposure may involve an increased activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0895-8378",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2004,"16",NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,"5","18",NA,"10.1080/08958370490442827",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000222605700002",15204789,97,"97 no 5"

Pharmacological inhibitors of cell-cycle progression may therefore have value in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in humans. GW8510 is a 3' substituted indolone that was developed recently as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). We found that GW8510 inhibits the death of cerebellar granule neurons caused by switching them from high potassium (HK) medium to low potassium (LK) medium. Although GW8510 inhibits CDK2 and other CDKs when tested in in vitro biochemical assays, when used on cultured neurons it only inhibits CDK5, a cytoplasmic CDK that is not associated with cell-cycle progression. Treatment of cultured HEK293T cells with GW8510 does not inhibit cell-cycle progression, consistent with its inability to inhibit mitotic CDKs in intact cells. Neuroprotection by GW8510 is independent of Akt and MEK-ERK signaling. Furthermore, GW8510 does not block the LK-induced activation of Gsk3b and, while inhibiting c-jun phosphorylation, does not inhibit the increase in c-jun expression observed in apoptotic neurons.

Improvements in long term health care have made elderly individuals a large and growing demographic group, marking these diseases as a major public health concern. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most studied form of neurodegenerative amyloidopathy. Although our understanding of AD is far from complete, several decades of research have advanced our knowledge to the point where it is conceivable that some form of disease modifying therapy may be available in the near future. These advances have been built on a strong mechanistic understanding of the disease from its underlying genetics, molecular biology and clinical pathology. Insights derived from the study of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as some forms of frontotemporal dementia, have been critical to this process. This knowledge has allowed researchers to construct animal models of the disease process that have paved the way towards the development of therapeutics.

The objective of this project was to comprehend the underlying molecular changes related to amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) processing pathway induced by GM1. Using suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH), we detected one prominent sequence with increased expression in human neuroblastoma cells that stably transfected with human APP695 cDNA treated with GM1. This transcript has high identity to human Ubiquilin 1 gene. Differential expression was initially confirmed by dot blot hybridization. This result was further authenticated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Furthermore, using Western blots, we discovered that GM1 stimulated the expression of Ubiquilin 1 in human neuroblastoma cells and rat cortical neurons while other gangliosides Asialo-GM1 and GD1b did not. Ubiquilin 1 is one of the candidate genes of AD, which have been shown to modulate the gamma-secretase components in the proteolytic processing of APP, and is therefore a putative candidate for further investigation of GM1 mechanisms in the etiology and pathology of AD.

The pathway leading to beta A4 is not yet fully established but could involve lysosomal degradation. It has been suggested that the beta A4 peptide is of neuronal or vascular origin. The beta A4 peptide is found in diffuse deposits in the cortex and cerebellum as well as in the basal ganglia before the classic senile plaques appear, mainly in layer m of the cerebral cortex. These diffuse deposits are devoid of degenerating neurites (i.e. containing abnormally phosphorylated tau protein). The classical senile plaques contain numerous degenerating neurites linking them to the connective network of the cortex. The intellectual deficit is correlated significantly to the density of the classical senile plaques but not to the density of the diffuse deposits. Although a mutation of the gene coding for the beta A4 peptide appears to be sufficient to induce (or accelerate) Alzheimer's disease, this is undoubtedly an exceptional mechanism. Certain mutations involving the beta A4 precursor protein gene increase in vitro the production of beta A4.

A plausible answer to the first question can be provided by the current conclusions of evolutionary biologists concerning nonadaptive mechanisms for the evolution of senescence. The second question has at least a partial answer in that, in a few rare pedigrees, there is compelling evidence that a specific gene mutation, involving the beta-amyloid precursor protein, is the primary cause of an early onset of the disease. Thus, we now have a metabolic pathway that serves as a working hypothesis for a candidate pathogenetic mechanism for all forms of the disorder.

An additional challenge is to discover environmental agents that can modulate the rates of development of specific components of the pathology, including beta-amyloido-genesis.

The possible increased risk of prostate cancer among pilots in comparison to the general population is a subject of debate. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the quality of supporting evidence and magnitude of this association. METHODS: All studies pertaining to prostate cancer in pilots were retrieved from multiple databases and from a manual search. Any study that assessed the incidence of prostate cancer relative to the incidence in the general population was included regardless of language or size. A random effect model was used to pool relative risks (RR) across studies. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic and I-2. RESULTS: Eight studies with a low risk of bias were included in the meta-analysis. Pilots had an increased risk of developing prostate cancer compared to the general population [RR 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-2.7]. The analysis was associated with substantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 79%). Several subgroups had significantly increased risk, such as African American pilots (RR 10.00; 95% CI, 5.04-19.86) and military pilots (RR 3.30; 95% CI, 2.03-5.39).

An interlocking mechanistic picture of an insertion and a free radical polymerization is revealed. Both polymerizations run simultaneously (25 bar ethylene, neat MMA, 70 C); however, the chain growth cycles are independent of each other, and therefore exclusively a physical mixture of homo-PE and homo-PMMA is obtained. A NiC bond cleavage was excluded as a free radical source. Rather a homolytic PC bond cleavage in the labile aryl phosphine ligand and the reaction of low-valent Ni(0/I) species with specific iodo substituted NO (ArI) ligands were shown to initiate radical MMA polymerizations. Several reductive elimination decomposition pathways of catalyst precursor or active intermediates were shown to form low-valent Ni species. One of those pathways is a bimolecular reductive coupling via intermediate (NO)Ni(I) formation.

Thus developing a sensitive and simple method for determination of Cu2+ is essential. Here, a novel and sensitive Cu2+ sensor was developed based on detecting the average hydrodynamic diameter of AuNPs by using dynamic light scattering (DLS). Cu2+-specific DNAzyme was double-strand and could not adsorb on the surface of AuNPs, accordingly AuNPs aggregation would occur with the addition of NaCl. However, Cu2+ could cleave DNAzyme and release single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fragments, which could adsorb on the surface of AuNPs and prevent them from aggregation. Such differences in DNA adsorption ability on AuNPs before and after the addition of Cu2+ affected the disperse state of AuNPs directly, and then affected their average hydrodynamic diameter, which could be detected with the DLS technique. Based upon the above mentioned principle, detection of Cu2+ could be realized over the range from 100 pM to 2.0 nM, with a linear regression equation of D = 306.73 - 89.66C (C: nM, R = 0.9953) and a detection limit of 60 pM (3 delta/slope).

This subcellular redistribution of mitochondria was accompanied by the accumulation of ROS in the nucleus, which was attenuated by suppressing perinuclear clustering of mitochondria with nocodazole to destabilize microtubules or with small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of dynein.

The photoconvertible histone H4-Dendra2 was used to label such regions in transfected HepG2 cells, and its position was followed up to next interphase. The distribution of labeled chromatin in daughter cells exhibited a non-random character. However, its distribution in a vast majority of daughter cells extensively differed from the original ones and the labeled nucleolus-associated chromatin differently located into the vicinity of different nucleoli. Therefore, our results were not consistent with a concept of preservation chromatin position. This conclusion was supported by the finding that the numbers of nucleoli significantly differed between the two daughter cells.

This study aims to describe clinical signs of rotavirus infections among neonates, with a particular focus on preterm infants, and to show the distribution of genotypes in a neonatal intensive care unit (N ICU). Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted at a regional NICU for 1 year. Stool specimens from every infant in the NICU were collected on admission, at weekly intervals, and from infants showing symptoms. Rotavirus antigens were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and genotypes were confirmed by Reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The infants were divided into three groups: symptomatic preterm infants with and without rotavirus-positive stools [Preterm(rota+) and Preterm(rota-), respectively] and symptomatic full- or near-term infants with rotavirus-positive stools [FT/NT(rota+)]. Demographic and outcome data were compared among these groups. Results: A total of 702 infants were evaluated for rotaviruses and 131 infants were included in this study. The prevalence of rotavirus infections was 25.2%. Preterm(rota+) differed from Preterm(rota-) and FT/NT(rota+) with respect to frequent feeding difficulty (p = 0.047 and 0.034, respectively) and higher percentage of neutropenia (p = 0.008 and 0.011, respectively). G4P[6] was the exclusive strain in both the Preterm (rota+) (97.7%) and FT/NT(rota+) (90.2%), and it was the same for nosocomial, institutional infections, and infections acquired at home. Conclusion: Systemic illness signs such as feeding difficulty and neutropenia are specific for preterm infants with rotavirus infections. G4P[6] was exclusive, regardless of preterm birth or locations of infections. This study might be helpful in developing policies for management and prevention of rotavirus infections in NICUs.

Vero cell, an African green monkey kidney cell line, was often used to isolate and propagate PEDV. Nonetheless, the target cells of PEDV in vivo are intestinal epithelial cells, during infection, intestinal epithelia would be damaged and resulted in digestive disorders. The immune functions of porcine epithelial cells and interactions with other immune cell populations display a number of differences compared to other species. Type I interferon (IFN) plays an important role in antiviral immune response. Limited reports showed that PEDV could inhibit type I interferon production. In this study, porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), the target cells of PEDV, were used as the infection model in vitro to identify the possible molecular mechanisms of PEDV-inhibition IFN-beta production. Results: PEDV not only failed to induce IFN-beta expression, but also inhibited dsRNA-mediated IFN-beta production in IECs. As the key IFN-beta transcription factors, we found that dsRNA-induced activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) was inhibited after PEDV infection, but not nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B). To identify the mechanism of PEDV intervention with dsRNA-mediated IFN-beta expression more accurately, the role of individual molecules of RIG-I signaling pathway were investigated. In the upstream of IRF-3, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-or inhibitor of kappa B kinase-epsilon (IKK epsilon)-mediated IFN-beta production was not blocked by PEDV, while RIG-I-and its adapter molecule IFN-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1)-mediated IFN-beta production were completely inhibited after PEDV infection. Conclusion: Taken together, our data demonstrated for the first time that PEDV infection of its target cell line, IECs, inhibited dsRNA-mediated IFN-beta production by blocking the activation of IPS-1 in RIG-I-mediated pathway.

These diverse functions reflect the ability of SIRTs to target and modify a broad spectrum of protein substrates, including cytoskeletal proteins, signalling components, transcription factors, and histones. SIRTs are also implicated in tumorigenesis as well as in the response of the tumour to chemotherapy. In particular, SIRT1 has been found to be overexpressed in many drug resistant cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that the role of SIRTs in drug resistance may be foremost related to their ability to target and modulate the activity of tumour suppressors, including p53, p73. E2F1, and FOXO3a. In other words, while SIRT-dependent deacetylation of transcription factors is normally used to fine-tune gene expression, this function is hijacked by cancer cells to evade proliferative arrest and cell death in response to chemotherapy. Consequently, interventions predicated on disrupting the interactions between tumour suppressors and SIRTs may be effective in circumventing or reversing drug resistance in cancer.

What is more, expression of constitutively activated mutants of Rac1 and/or Cdc42 is sufficient for their malignant transformation. The role for these two Rho GTPases in HRas-mediated transformation of human fibroblasts has not been studied. Here we evaluated the contribution of Rac1 and Cdc42 to maintaining HRas-induced transformation of human fibroblasts, and determined the ability of constitutively activated mutants of Rac1 or Cdc42 to induce malignant transformation of a human fibroblast cell strain. Methods: Under the control of a tetracycline regulatable promoter, dominant negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 were expressed in a human HRas-transformed, tumor derived fibroblast cell line. These cells were used to determine the roles of Rac1 and/or Cdc42 proteins in maintaining HRas-induced transformed phenotypes. Similarly, constitutively active mutants were expressed in a non-transformed human fibroblast cell strain to evaluate their potential to induce malignant transformation. Affymetrix GeneChip arrays were used for transcriptome analyses, and observed expression differences were subsequently validated using protein assays. Results: Expression of dominant negative Rac1 and/or Cdc42 significantly altered transformed phenotypes of HRas malignantly transformed human fibroblasts. In contrast, expression of constitutively active mutants of Rac1 or Cdc42 was not sufficient to induce malignant transformation. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of 29 genes was dependent on Rac1 and Cdc42, many of which are known to play a role in cancer. The dependence of two such genes, uPA and VEGF was further validated in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Conclusion(s): The results presented here indicate that expression of both Rac1 and Cdc42 is necessary for maintaining several transformed phenotypes in oncogenic HRas transformed human cells, including their ability to form tumors in athymic mice. Our data also indicate that expression of either activated Rac1 or Cdc42 alone is not sufficient for malignant transformation of human fibroblasts, although each is required for specific transformed phenotypes.

Production of AAT by the liver maintains 0.9-1.75 mg/mL circulating levels. During acute-phase responses, circulating AAT levels increase more than fourfold. In individuals with one of several inherited mutations in AAT, low circulating levels increase the risk for lung, liver and pancreatic destructive diseases, particularly emphysema. These individuals are treated with lifelong weekly infusions of human plasma-derived AAT. An increasing amount of evidence appears to suggest that AAT possesses not only the ability to inhibit serine proteases, such as elastase and proteinase-3 (PR-3), but also to exert antiinflammatory and tissue-protective effects independent of protease inhibition. AAT modifies dendritic cell maturation and promotes T regulatory cell differentiation, induces interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist and IL-10 release, protects various cell types from cell death, inhibits caspases-1 and -3 activity and inhibits IL-1 production and activity. Importantly, unlike classic immunosuppressants, AAT allows undeterred isolated T-lymphocyte responses. On the basis of preclinical and clinical studies, AAT therapy for nondeficient individuals may interfere with disease progression in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, transplant rejection, graft versus host disease and multiple sclerosis. AAT also appears to be antibacterial and an inhibitor of viral infections, such as influenza and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and is currently evaluated in clinical trials for type 1 diabetes, cystic fibrosis and graft versus host disease. Thus, AAT therapy appears to have advanced from replacement therapy, to a safe and potential treatment for a broad spectrum of inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases.

Control of initiation, duration, and magnitude of PAR effects is linked to the level of receptor expression, availability of proteases, and the intracellular signal transduction machinery. We investigated nematode infection-induced changes in PAR(2) expression and the impact on smooth muscle and epithelial responses to PAR(2) agonists. Methods Smooth muscle and epithelial cell function were assessed in wild-type, and IL-4, IL-13 or STAT6 gene-deficient mice following treatment with vehicle, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or Heligmosomoides polygyrus, or IL-13. The role of enteric nerves was determined using tetrodotoxin to block nerve conduction. Expression of PAR(2) was assessed by real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Key Results Nematode infection induced a STAT6- and IL-13-dependent up-regulation of PAR(2) mRNA expression. The infection-induced hypercontractility to PAR(2) agonists required STAT6/IL-13 and was neurally mediated. In contrast, the infection-induced decrease in epithelial secretion to PAR(2) agonists was partly dependent on STAT6 and independent of enteric nerves. The hyposecretion was correlated with decreased PAR(2) immunofluorescent staining on the apical surface of epithelial cells, but enhanced lamina propria immunostaining for PAR(2). Conclusions & Inferences This is the first study to demonstrate an immune regulation of PAR(2) expression that impacts both smooth muscle and epithelial cell responses to PAR(2) agonists. Differences in responses between smooth muscle and epithelial cells are related to the contribution of enteric nerves.

Therefore, in this study, we sought to characterize ex vivo the early events of shigellosis in a model of human colonic explants.

We also aimed at determining the putative lesions of the enteric nervous system induced by S. flexneri. Methodology/Principal Findings: We first showed that, following 3 h of infection, the invasive but not the non-invasive strain of S. flexneri induced significant desquamation of the intestinal epithelial barrier and a reduction of epithelial height. These changes were significantly reduced following infection with SepA deficient S. flexneri strains. Secondly, S. flexneri induced rapid neuronal morphological alterations suggestive of cell death in enteric submucosal neurones. These alterations were associated with a significant increase in the proportion of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) immunoreactive (IR) neurons but not in total VIP levels.

Apart from its actions via ROCK, RhoA has recently been found to activate a scaffold protein MEKK1 known to promote ERK activation. We examined whether RhoA can substantially affect ERK activity via this MEKK1-mediated crosstalk between RhoA and EGFR-ERK pathway. By extending the published EGFR-ERK simulation models represented by ordinary differential equations, we developed a simulation model that includes this crosstalk, which was validated with a number of experimental findings and published simulation results. Results: Our simulation suggested that, via this crosstalk, RhoA elevation substantially prolonged duration of ERK activation at both normal and reduced Ras levels. Our model suggests ERK may be activated in the absence of Ras. When Ras is overexpressed, RhoA elevation significantly prolongs duration of ERK activation but reduces the amount of active ERK partly due to competitive binding between ERK and RhoA to MEKK1.

We aim at understanding the underlying molecular network. Along this line, possible roles of Rho GTPases that act as molecular switches to control a variety of signal transduction pathways remain virtually unexplored, as are putative interactions between Rho proteins and additional known components of this cascade. Results: We investigated the role of Rho/Rock signaling in neural crest delamination. Active RhoA and RhoB are expressed in the membrane of epithelial progenitors and are downregulated upon delamination. In vivo loss-of-function of RhoA or RhoB or of overall Rho signaling by C3 transferase enhanced and/or triggered premature crest delamination yet had no effect on cell specification. Consistently, treatment of explanted neural primordia with membrane-permeable C3 or with the Rock inhibitor Y27632 both accelerated and enhanced crest emigration without affecting cell proliferation. These treatments altered neural crest morphology by reducing stress fibers, focal adhesions and downregulating membrane-bound N-cadherin. Reciprocally, activation of endogenous Rho by lysophosphatidic acid inhibited emigration while enhancing the above. Since delamination is triggered by BMP and requires G1/S transition, we examined their relationship with Rho. Blocking Rho/Rock function rescued crest emigration upon treatment with noggin or with the G1/S inhibitor mimosine. In the latter condition, cells emigrated while arrested at G1. Conversely, BMP4 was unable to rescue cell emigration when endogenous Rho activity was enhanced by lysophosphatidic acid.

Restenosis of these arteries has remained a major limitation of the application of these procedures, especially in the case of balloon angioplasty. Post-angioplasty restenosis results from two major processes: neointimal formation and constrictive remodelling. Neointimal formation is initiated by arterial injury with a resultant loss of contractile phenotype in tunica media, leading to VSMC [vascular SM (smooth muscle) cell] migration from the tunica media to the intima. Migrated VSMCs contribute to the intimal thickening by the excessive synthesis of ECM (extracellular matrix) and proliferation. However, increased neointimal mass is not solely responsible for luminal narrowing. Inward constrictive remodelling is also considered as a major cause of delayed failure of angioplasty. At later stages after angioplasty, the increase in contractile forces leads to lumen narrowing. Recent studies show that SM contractile proteins are re-expressed in the neointima, concomitant with late lumen loss. Therefore one important question is whether the restoration of contractile phenotype, which can suppress VSMC migration, is favourable or detrimental. In this review, the importance of viewing restenosis as a multistage process is discussed. Different stages of restenosis occur in a sequential manner and are related to each other, but in each stage a different strategy should be taken into consideration to reduce restenosis. Defining the role of each process not only reshapes the current concept, but also helps us to target restenosis with more efficacy.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0143-5221",NA,NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2008,"114","04-Mar",NA,NA,NA,NA,"257","264",NA,"10.1042/CS20070228",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000253093300009",18194134,113,"113 no 3"

Active ingredients from natural products may be used as drugs in chemotherapy for human cancers. Here, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to probe the formation and recognition of the G-quadruplex structure from the G-rich sequence that is found in the c-myb gene promoter, 5'-GGGCTGGGCTGGGCGGGG-3'. The aim of our study is to evaluate a potential binder for the c-myb gene from natural products, and thereby to modulate c-myb gene expression. METHODS: ESI-MS, as an effective method, was utilized not only to characterize the formation of the G-quadruplex in the c-myb oncogene, but also as a tool to probe the binding characteristics of alkaloid moleculeswith the target G-quadruplexDNA. RESULTS: ESI-MS results with the support of circular dichroism (CD) spectra demonstrated the formation of an intramolecular parallel-stranded G-quadruplex in the c-myb oncogene promoter. A screening of six alkaloid molecules showed that brucine (P1) had a strong binding affinity to the c-myb G-quadruplex DNA. It is notable that P1 can bind selectively to the c-myb G-quadruplex with respect to duplex DNAs, as well as to G-quadruplexes in other types of gene sequences. According to ESI-MS results, in which the stability was tested by capillary heating and collision-induced dissociation, the binding of P1 could thermally stabilize the c-myb G-quadruplex DNA. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, brucine (P1), an alkaloid molecule, has been found to bind to the intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex in the c-myb oncogene promoter with high affinity and selectivity, and could thermally stabilize the c-myb G-quadruplex DNA, indicating that the binding of P1 has the potential to modulate c-myb gene expression.

In addition, biochemical analyses of dynein from one mutant strain show a strong correlation between its in vitro biochemical properties and the aberrant intracellular function of that altered dynein. When the mutations were mapped to the published dynein crystal structure, we found that the three-dimensional structural locations of the heavy chain mutations were linked to particular classes of altered dynein functions observed in cells. Together, our data indicate that the five classes of dynein mutations represent the entrapment of dynein at five separate points in the dynein mechanochemical and transport cycles.

To this end, we have used the newly solved X-ray structures of dynein motor domain to perform a coarse-grained modeling of dynein's post-and pre-powerstroke conformation and the conformational transition between them. First, we have used normal mode analysis to identify a single normal mode that captures the coupled motions of AAA1-AAA2 closing and linker domain rotation, which enables the ATP-driven recovery stroke of dynein. Second, based on the post-powerstroke conformation solved crystallographically, we have modeled dynein's pre-powerstroke conformation by computationally inducing AAA1-AAA2 closing and sliding of coiled coil stalk, and the resulting model features a linker domain near the pre-powerstroke position and a slightly tilted stalk. Third, we have modeled the conformational transition from pre- to post-powerstroke conformation, which predicts a clear sequence of structural events that couple microtubule binding, powerstroke and product release, and supports a signaling path from stalk to AAA1 via AAA3 and AAA4. Finally, we have found that a closed AAA3-AAA4 interface (compatible with nucleotide binding) is essential to the mechanochemical coupling in dynein. Our modeling not only offers unprecedented structural insights to the motor function of dynein as described by past single-molecule, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and electron microscopy studies, but also provides new predictions for future experiments to test.

Although previous studies have demonstrated cortical and plus-end targeting of dynein heavy chain (Dyn1/HC), the regulation of its recruitment to these sites remains elusive. Results: Here we show that separate domains of Dyn1/HC confer differential localization to the dynein complex. The N-terminal tail domain targets Dyn1/HC to cortical Num1 receptor sites, whereas the C-terminal motor domain targets Dyn1/HC to microtubule plus ends in a Bik1/CLIP-170- and Pac1/LIS1-dependent manner. Surprisingly, the isolated motor domain blocks plus-end targeting of Dyn1/HC, leading to a dominant-negative effect on dynein function. Overexpression of Pac1/LIS1, but not Bik1/CLIP-170, rescues the dominant negativity by restoring Dyn1/HC to plus ends. In contrast, the isolated tail domain has no inhibitory effect on Dyn1/HC targeting and function. However, cortical targeting of the tail construct is more robust than full-length Dyn1/HC and occurs independently of Bik1/CLIP-170 or Pac1/LIS1.

The whole-cell patch-clamp technique and mutagenesis approach were used to examine the effects of H2S on different K-ATP channel subunits, rvKir6.1 and rvSUR1, heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells. H2S stimulated coexpressed rvKir6.1/rvSUR1 K-ATP channels, but had no effect on K-ATP currents generated by rvKir6.1 expression alone. Intracellularly applied sulfhydryl alkylating agent (N-ethylmaleimide, NEM), oxidizing agent (chloramine T, CLT), and a disulfide bond-oxidizing enzyme (protein disulfide isomerase) did not alter H2S effects on this recombinant channels. CLT, but not NEM, inhibited basal rvKir6.1/rvSUR1 currents, and both abolished the stimulatory effects of H2S on K-ATP currents, when applied extracellularly. After selective cysteine residues (C6S and C26S but not C1051S and C1057S) in the extracellular loop of rvSUR1 subunits were point-mutated, H2S lost its stimulatory effects on rvKir6.1/rvSUR1 currents. Our results demonstrate that H2S interacts with Cys6 and Cys26 residues of the extracellular N terminal of rvSUR1 subunit of K-ATP channel complex.

In this study, we demonstrate that the profligacy of human CSE results in a variety of reactions that generate H2S from cysteine and homocysteine. The gamma-replacement reaction, which condenses two molecules of homocysteine, yields H2S and a novel biomarker, homolanthionine, which has been reported in urine of homocystinuric patients, whereas a beta-replacement reaction, which condenses two molecules of cysteine, generates lanthionine. Kinetic simulations at physiologically relevant concentrations of cysteine and homocysteine, reveal that the alpha,beta-elimination of cysteine accounts for similar to 70% of H2S generation. However, the relative importance of homocysteine-derived H2S increases progressively with the grade of hyperhomocysteinemia, and under conditions of severely elevated homocysteine (200 mu M), the alpha,beta-elimination and gamma-replacement reactions of homocysteine together are predicted to account for similar to 90% of H2S generation by CSE.

This review shows that most documented cases of scientific fraud involve falsification (altering truthful information) and fabrication (inventing information where none previously existed). Plagiarism is much less frequent. The review of published accounts also shows that the publication of scientific papers containing recognizable fraudulent material is very low, probably less than 0.02% and extremely difficult to detect. Because most reported cases of fraud have involved research done at prestigious organizations with distinguished co-authors, and that is published in journals with exacting review processes, it becomes evident that some unscrupulous scientists are adept at fabricating and falsifying data. However, ""significant"" scientific fraud is detected when scientists repeatedly report results that cannot be independently verified, when colleagues report suspicious behaviour, or scientific audits are performed. This review documents and compares many of the better-known cases of scientific fraud.

However, the role of GERD in laryngeal cancer remains controversial because of poor matching and selection of inappropriate control groups in prior studies. We aimed to better understand this relationship by conducting a matched case-control study. METHODS: This study was based in a single tertiary care center over a 2-year period. Cases included all patients with a diagnosis of new laryngeal cancer presenting to the otolaryngology clinics. Two controls, derived from the internal medicine clinics, were matched to the cases on an individual basis for age ( within 1 year), gender, ethnicity, and time of first visit to the institution ( within 1 month). Data were extracted by chart review. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between laryngeal cancer and GERD, tobacco, and alcohol consumption. RESULTS: A total of 96 cases were matched to 192 controls. On univariable analysis, the significant risk factors were current smoking, odds ratio ( OR) 5.46 ( 95% confidence interval [ CI], 2.59-11.50); alcohol, OR 1.97 ( CI, 1.19-3.26); and GERD, OR 1.79 ( CI ,1.03-3.11). On multivariable analysis, only smoking and GERD continued to be significantly associated with laryngeal cancer, OR 6.08 ( CI, 2.82-13.10) and OR 2.11 ( CI, 1.16-3.85), respectively.

To evaluate the overall strength of the association of GERD with laryngeal cancer, we performed meta-analysis of the original studies in literature. Study Design: Meta-analysis. Methods. All studies cited on Ovid Medline (1966,June 2004), EMBASE (1980-June 2004), and Cochrane database describing GERD and laryngeal cancer were eligible for inclusion. The inclusion criteria for the study included original controlled study design and a clear documentation of the reflux prevalence in cases and controls. Statistical analysis was performed by NCSS software. Results. Fifteen original studies were identified. Eight studies did not have control groups, two studies did not clearly document GERD prevalence in controls, and two studies were published using the same data, one of which was included in this meta-analysis. Thus, four studies qualified for inclusion for the meta-analysis. The methodologic quality in the studies was heterogeneous, not only in the evaluation of confounding risk factors such as smoking and alcohol but also in the mode of GERD diagnosis. There was also significant heterogeneity of effect of reflux among the studies (P = .001). The pooled odds ratio on the basis of fixed-effects model was 2.86 (95% CI, 2.73-2.99), and on the basis of random-effects model was 2.37 (95% CI 1.38-4.08).

Thirty DBA/1J mice were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 10 per group): the control group, the CIA group, and the CIA + IL-35 group. Collagen-induced arthritis was induced by immunization with collagen. IL-35 was intraperitoneally injected daily for 10 days, starting from the 24(th) day after immunization. FLS cells were isolated and cultured from CIA. The expression of IL-17, RANKL, and OPG was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Each experiment was repeated three times. CIA mice exhibited arthritis symptoms on day 24, followed by a rapid progression of arthritis. The expression of IL-17 and RANKL was increased and the expression of OPG was decreased in CIA mice compared with control mice. IL-35 treatment inhibited the development of arthritis in CIA mice, accompanied by a decrease in the expression of IL-17 and RANKL and an increase in the expression of OPG. Furthermore, IL-35 dose-dependently inhibited the expression of RANKL and increased the expression of OPG in cultured FLS cells.

The aim of this study is to evaluate gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), saliva, and plasma levels of IL-35 in periodontal disease and health. Methods: Samples of GCF, whole saliva, and plasma were obtained from systemically healthy, non-smoking individuals with gingivitis (n = 20) or chronic periodontitis (CP) (n = 20) and periodontally healthy individuals (n = 20). Full-mouth clinical periodontal measurements, including probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing, gingival index, and plaque index (PI), were also recorded. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine IL-35 levels in the samples. Data were tested statistically by analysis of variance and Pearson rank correlation test. . Results: All clinical parameters were significantly higher in the CP group than the healthy and gingivitis groups (P <0.001). The GCF total amount of IL-35 was significantly higher in the CP group than the other groups (P = 0.04), whereas the GCF concentration of IL-35 was significantly higher in the healthy group than the other groups (P = 0.002). There were significant differences among the study groups in terms of salivary IL-35 level (P <0.001), with the highest level observed in the healthy group and the lowest in the CP group. There was no statistical difference between groups in plasma levels of IL-35 (P >0.05). There was a positive correlation between GCF total amount of IL-35 and PD (r = 0.338, P = 0.03) and PI (r = 0.374, P = 0.005) parameters.

Instead, recent reports in psychological science have used apparently scientific methods to report strong evidence for unbelievable claims such as precognition. To try to resolve the apparent conflict between unbelievable claims and the scientific method many researchers turn to empirical replication to reveal the truth. Such an approach relies on the belief that true phenomena can be successfully demonstrated in well-designed experiments, and the ability to reliably reproduce an experimental outcome is widely considered the gold standard of scientific investigations. Unfortunately, this view is incorrect; and misunderstandings about replication contribute to the conflicts in psychological science. Because experimental effects in psychology are measured by statistics, there should almost always be some variability in the reported outcomes. An absence of such variability actually indicates that experimental replications are invalid, perhaps because of a bias to suppress contrary findings or because the experiments were run improperly. Recent investigations have demonstrated how to identify evidence of such invalid experiment sets and noted its appearance for prominent findings in experimental psychology. The present manuscript explores those investigative methods by using computer simulations to demonstrate their properties and limitations. The methods are shown to be a check on the statistical consistency of a set of experiments by comparing the reported power of the experiments with the reported frequency of statistical significance. Overall, the methods are extremely conservative about reporting inconsistency when experiments are run properly and reported fully. The manuscript also considers how to improve scientific practice to avoid inconsistency, and discusses criticisms of the investigative method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A focus on the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia and in the attenuation of injury is presented. Particular attention is given to cardiomyocyte death (apoptosis and necrosis), fibrosis, neovascularization, and heart failure.

We report here the annotation of the core genes in the small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways in M. destructor. While most of the miRNA pathway genes were highly conserved across the species studied, the siRNA pathway genes showed increased relative variability in comparison to the miRNA pathway.

Indeed, it is of interest that a Sid-1 homolog has not been detected in any dipteran species to date. We hypothesize the sequence architecture of the PAZ domain in the M. destructor DCR-2 protein is related to reduced efficacy of this enzyme and this taken together with the lack of a Sid-1 homolog may account for the weak RNAi response observed to date in this species as well as other dipteran species.

Phylogenetics, and the study of evolution in general, is quickly migrating towards using HTS to generate larger and more complex molecular datasets. In this paper, we present a method that utilizes microfluidic PCR and HTS to generate large amounts of sequence data suitable for phylogenetic analyses. The approach uses the Fluidigm Access Array System (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA, USA) and two sets of PCR primers to simultaneously amplify 48 target regions across 48 samples, incorporating sample-specific barcodes and HTS adapters (2,304 unique amplicons per Access Array). The final product is a pooled set of amplicons ready to be sequenced, and thus, there is no need to construct separate, costly genomic libraries for each sample. Further, we present a bioinformatics pipeline to process the raw HTS reads to either generate consensus sequences (with or without ambiguities) for every locus in every sample or-more importantly-recover the separate alleles from heterozygous target regions in each sample. This is important because it adds allelic information that is well suited for coalescent-based phylogenetic analyses that are becoming very common in conservation and evolutionary biology. To test our approach and bioinformatics pipeline, we sequenced 576 samples across 96 target regions belonging to the South American clade of the genus Bartsia L. in the plant family Orobanchaceae. After sequencing cleanup and alignment, the experiment resulted in similar to 25,300bp across 486 samples for a set of 48 primer pairs targeting the plastome, and similar to 13,500bp for 363 samples for a set of primers targeting regions in the nuclear genome.

It is also known that probabilistic alignments based on marginal probabilities (e. g. aligned-column and/or gap probabilities) provide more accurate alignment than conventional maximum score-based alignment. There exists, however, no study about probabilistic alignment that considers quality scores explicitly, although the method is expected to be useful in SNP/indel callers and bisulfite mapping, because accurate estimation of aligned columns or gaps is important in those analyses. Results: In this study, we propose methods of probabilistic alignment that consider quality scores of (one of) the sequences as well as a usual score matrix. The method is based on posterior decoding techniques in which various marginal probabilities are computed from a probabilistic model of alignments with quality scores, and can arbitrarily trade-off sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of prediction (aligned columns and gaps). The method is directly applicable to read mapping (alignment) toward accurate detection of SNPs and indels.

Despite the growing popularity of WM trainings, underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Resistance to proactive interference (PI) constitutes a candidate process that contributes to WM performance and might influence training or transfer effects. Here, we investigated whether PI resistance can be enhanced in older adults using a WM training with specifically increased PI-demands. Further, we investigated whether potential effects of such a training were stable and entailed any transfer on non-trained tasks. Method: Healthy old adults (N = 25, 68.8 5.5 years) trained with a recent-probes and an n-back task daily for two weeks. Two different training regimens (high vs. low PI-amount in the tasks) were applied as between-participants manipulation, to which participants were randomly assigned. Near transfer tasks included interference tasks; far transfer tasks assessed fluid intelligence (gF) or speed. Immediate transfer was assessed directly after training; a follow-up measurement was conducted after two months. Results: Both groups similarly improved in PI resistance in both training tasks. Thus, PI susceptibility was generally reduced in the two training groups and there was no difference between WM training with high versus low PI demands. Further, there was no differential near or far transfer on non-trained tasks, neither immediately after the training nor in the follow-up. Conclusion: PI-demands in WM training tasks do not seem critical for enhancing WM performance or PI resistance in older adults.

Recent work has suggested that the effects of WM training extend to general fluid intelligence, attentional control, and reductions in symptoms of ADHD. We present a theoretically motivated perspective of WM and subsequently review the WM training literature in light of several concerns. These include (a) the tendency for researchers to define change to abilities using single tasks, (b) inconsistent use of valid WM tasks, (c) no-contact control groups, and (d) subjective measurement of change. The literature review highlights several findings that warrant further research but ultimately concludes that there is a need to directly demonstrate that WM capacity increases in response to training. Specifically, we argue that transfer of training to WM must be demonstrated using a wider variety of tasks, thus eliminating the possibility that results can be explained by task specific learning. Additionally, we express concern that many of the most promising results (e.g., increased intelligence) cannot be readily attributed to changes in WM capacity.

Objectives To assess the effects of periurethral or transurethral injection therapy on the cure or improvement of urinary incontinence in women. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 8 November 2010) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatment for urinary incontinence in which at least one management arm involved periurethral or transurethral injection therapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality of each study using explicit criteria. Data extraction was undertaken independently and clarification concerning possible unreported data sought directly from the investigators. Main results Excluding duplicate reports, we identified 14 trials (excluding one that was subsequently withdrawn from publication and not included in this analysis) including 2004 women that met the inclusion criteria. The limited data available were not suitable for meta-analysis because they all came from separate trials. Trials were small and generally of moderate quality. One trial of 45 women that compared injection therapy with conservative treatment showed early benefit for the injectable with respect to continence grade (risk ratio (RR) 0.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.94) and quality of life (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.92). Another, comparing Injection of autologous fat with placebo, terminated early because of safety concerns. Two trials that compared injection with surgical management found significantly better objective cure in the surgical group (RR 4.77, 95% CI 1.96 to 11.64; and RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.79), although the latter trial data did not reach statistical significance if an intention-to-treat analysis was used. Eight trials compared different agents and all results had wide confidence intervals. Silicone particles, calcium hydroxylapatite, ethylene vinyl alcohol, carbon spheres and dextranomer hyaluronic acid combination gave improvements which were not shown to be more or less efficacious than collagen. Dextranomer hyaluronic acid compound treated patients appeared to have significantly higher rates of injection site complications (16% with the hyaluronic acid compound versus none with collagen; RR 37.78, 95% CI 2.34 to 610) and this product has now been withdrawn from the market. A comparison of periurethral and transurethral methods of injection found similar outcomes but a higher (though not statistically significant) rate of early complications in the periurethral group. One trial of 30 women showed a weak (but not clinically significant) advantage for patient satisfaction (data not suitable for analysis in Revman) after mid-urethral injection in comparison to bladder neck injection but with no demonstrable difference in continence levels. Authors' conclusions The available evidence base remains insufficient to guide practice. In addition, the finding that placebo saline injection was followed by a similar symptomatic improvement to bulking agent injection raises questions about the mechanism of any beneficial effects. One small trial comparing silicone particles with pelvic floor muscle training was suggestive of benefit at three months but it is not known if this was sustained, and the treatment was associated with high levels of postoperative retention and dysuria. Greater symptomatic improvement was observed with surgical treatments, though the advantages need to be set against likely higher risks. No clear-cut conclusions could be drawn from trials comparing alternative agents, although dextranomer hyaluronic acid was associated with more local side effects and is no longer commercially available for this indication. There is insufficient evidence to show superiority of mid-urethral or bladder neck injection.

Methods: The authors studied immune response activation by phenotypic and functional characterization of lymphocytes accumulated within this tissue. Intracapsular lymphoid cells and autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. The proportion of T regulatory cells (CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+)CD127(+)), the cytokine profiles, and the T cell receptor repertoire of these cells were examined. Intracapsular T regulatory cells were then further analyzed by immunohistochemistry and functional suppression assays. Results: In comparison with peripheral blood, the cellular composition of intracapsular lymphocytes showed a predominance of CD4(+) cells. Intracapsular T cells predominantly produced interleukin-17, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, transforming growth factor-beta 1, and interferon-gamma, suggesting a TH1/TH17-weighted local immune response. Intracapsular T cells displayed a restricted T cell receptor alpha/beta repertoire. The intact suppressive potential of T regulatory cells was demonstrated in crossover experiments with activated peripheral T cells. They did not, however, suppress intracapsular T cells. Interestingly, ratios of intracapsular T regulatory cells were inversely proportional to the clinical degree of capsular fibrosis. Conclusion: The authors' results indicate that silicone implants trigger a specific, antigen-driven local immune response through activated TH1/TH17 cells, suggesting that ensuing fibrosis is promoted by the production of profibrotic cytokines as a consequence of faltering function of local T regulatory cells.

Even COT is feasible and safe in selected cases after liver transplantation, in the clinical arena of solid organ transplantation, tolerance remains, for the most part, a concept rather than a reality. Although modern immunosuppression regimens have effectively handled acute rejection, nearly all organs except the liver commonly suffer chronic immunologic damage that impairs organ function, threatening patient and allograft survival. Strong arguments in favour of conducting clinical tolerance trials are the high number of grafts still lost due to chronic rejection, the burden of serious adverse effects from immunosuppressants which causes considerable cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, respectively, and the fact that sporadic tolerance can be observed in rare cases where non-adherence to immunosuppressive regimens is linked with a state of long-lasting organ tolerance. Whereas molecule-based regimens have been largely ineffective, cell-based tolerance protocols have delivered some encouraging results to achieve COT. In combination with donor bone marrow-derived stem cells, some encouraging results in COT development were reported lately for renal transplantation as well. However, less toxic conditioning protocols and more experience by use of cell products with regulatory properties in combination with synergizing immunosuppressive drugs is required to launch future tolerance trials for a broader spectrum of potential transplant candidates.

We explored the association between the COMT genotype and three chronic pain conditions: migrainous headache, fibromyalgia, or chronic widespread pain and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Furthermore, we evaluated whether COMT genotype affects the efficacy of opioids in chronic pain. After a systematic literature review, we carried out meta-analyses on the three chronic pain conditions. The efficacy of opioids was evaluated using a systematic review only. The meta-analyses showed that fibromyalgia or chronic widespread pain is the only type of chronic pain that could be associated with the COMT single nucleotide polymorphism rs4680 (Val158Met). Met158, which results in the low-activity variant of COMT, is the risk allele. In chronic clinical pain, the effect of the COMT polymorphism depends on the pain condition. Low COMT activity is not associated with migrainous headache or chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions, but it may increase the risk for fibromyalgia or chronic widespread pain. Low COMT activity increases opioid receptors and enhances opioid analgesia and adverse effects in some cancer pains. Findings from animal studies that have utilized COMT inhibitors elucidate the mechanism behind these findings. In rodent pain models, COMT inhibitors are pronociceptive, except for neuropathic pain models, where nitecapone was found to be antiallodynic. The complex interplay between enhanced adrenergic and dopaminergic activity in different parts of the nociceptive system probably explains the complicated actions of low COMT activity.

COMT polymorphisms modulate pain and opioid analgesia in humans. In rats, COMT inhibitors have been shown to be pro-nociceptive in acute pain models, but also to attenuate allodynia and hyperalgesia in a model of diabetic neuropathy. Here, we have assessed the effects of acute and repeated administrations of COMT inhibitors on mechanical, thermal and carrageenan-induced nociception in male mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We used single and repeated administration of a peripherally restricted, short-acting (nitecapone) and also a centrally acting (3,5-dinitrocatechol, OR-486) COMT inhibitor. We also tested CGP 28014, an indirect inhibitor of COMT enzyme. Effects of OR-486 on thermal nociception were also studied in COMT deficient mice. Effects on spinal pathways were assessed in rats given intrathecal nitecapone. KEY RESULTS After single administration, both nitecapone and OR-486 reduced mechanical nociceptive thresholds and thermal nociceptive latencies (hot plate test) at 2 and 3 h, regardless of their brain penetration. These effects were still present after chronic treatment with COMT inhibitors for 5 days. Intraplantar injection of carrageenan reduced nociceptive latencies and both COMT inhibitors potentiated this reduction without modifying inflammation. CGP 28014 shortened paw flick latencies. OR-486 did not modify hot plate times in Comt gene deficient mice. Intrathecal nitecapone modified neither thermal nor mechanical nociception.

Therefore, their activation state and functional differentiation need to be tightly controlled. The activating stimuli and their signaling networks have long been an area of focus in DC research. Recent investigations have also shed light on the mechanisms of counterregulation and fine-tuning of DC functions. One class of proteins involved in these processes is the family of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), whose members were originally described as feedback inhibitors of cytokine-induced JAK/STAT signaling. Essential roles in DC function have been assigned to SOCS1 and SOCS3. In this article, we show that SOCS2 also is involved in DC regulation. In human and in murine DCs, SOCS2 is a highly TLR-responsive gene, which is expressed in a time-delayed fashion beginning 8 h after TLR ligation. Functionally, silencing of SOCS2 in DCs results in hyperphosphorylation of STAT3 at later time points. As a consequence, SOCS2-deficient DCs secrete increased amounts of the cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-10, both being transcriptional targets of STAT3. We propose a model in which SOCS2 acts as a negative regulator of TLR-induced DC activation. The delayed expression of SOCS2 provides a mechanism of late-phase counterregulation and limitation of inflammation-driving DC activity.

We therefore evaluated whether fat-1 transgenic mice, a well-controlled experimental model endogenously synthesizing n-3 PUFA, were protected against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. We then aimed to elucidate the in vivo response at the pancreatic level. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-beta-Cell destruction was produced by multiple low-doses STZ (MLD-STZ). Blood glucose level, plasma insulin level, and plasma lipid analysis were then performed. Pancreatic mRNA expression of cytokines, the monocyte chemoattractant protein, and GLUT2 were evaluated as well as pancreas nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B p65 and inhibitor of kappa B (I kappa B) protein expression. Insulin and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining and lipidomic analysis were performed in the pancreas. RESULTS-STZ-induced fat-1 mice did not develop hyperglycemia compared with wild-type mice, and beta-cell destruction was prevented as evidenced by lack of histological pancreatic damage or reduced insulin level. The prevention of beta-cell destruction was associated with no proinflammatory cytokine induction (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, inducible nitric oxide synthase) in the pancreas, a decreased NF-kappa B, and increased I kappa B pancreatic protein expression. In the fat-1-treated mice, proinflammatory arachidonic-derived mediators as prostaglandin E-2 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were decreased and the anti-inflammatory lipoxin A(4) was detected. Moreover, the 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid, precursor of the anti-inflammatory resolvin E1, was highly increased. CONCLUSIONS-Collectively, these findings indicate that fat-1 mice were protected against MLD-STZ-induced diabetes and pointed out for the first time in vivo the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA at the pancreatic level, on each step of the development of the pathology-inflammation, beta-cell damage-through cytokine response and lipid mediator production.

These symptoms, which result from microtubule damage in the axon extensions of hippocampal neurons in during menopause, greatly reduce individuals' life quality. Thus, an investigation of the estrogen receptor-signaling pathway-microtubule dynamic triangle and the possible links between them is important when it comes to explaining the possible mechanism of neurodegeneration. Hematopoietic Pbx-interaction protein (HPIP), a microtubule-binding protein, is a novel scaffolding protein. The detection of this protein on neurons represents the most important step in our hypothesis. The importance of the hypothesis is that it might provide important clues about the possible role of HPIP and its mechanism through in vivo and in vitro studies of estrogen receptors-microtubules and the HPIP triangle in terms of neuronal degeneration in the post-menopausal period. A preliminary study was performed to test the main part of our hypothesis using real-time PCR. According to the results, the mRNA expression of HPIP was found in hippocampal neurons. After the detection of this novel protein in neurons, it was observed that there were differences in the experimental groups when compared with the control group relating to the mRNA expression of this protein. An important scientific question remains concerning the mechanisms of neurodegeneration appearing in the post-menopausal period and the receptors, proteins, and signaling pathways that play a role in this degeneration. In consideration of the data from in vivo and in vitro studies used to test our hypothesis, we will try to address the relevant questions. As this issue is resolved, new studies and treatment procedures that can help to prevent the possible difficulties in the menopausal period will be illuminated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We have previously reported that the binding of 14-3-3 protein to its target proteins, including CDC25B, Rictor and TAZ, is inhibited by the interaction of 14-3-3 protein with SelW. However, the binding mechanism is unclear. In this study, we sought to determine the binding site of SelW to understand the regulatory mechanism of the interaction between SelW and 14-3-3 and its biological effects. Phosphorylated Ser(pS) or Thr(pT) residues in RSXpSXP or RXXXp(S/T)XP motifs are well-known common 14-3-3-binding sites, but Thr41, Ser59, and T69 of SelW, which are computationally predicted to serve are phosphorylation sites, were neither phosphorylation sites nor sites involved in the interaction. A mutant SelW in which Sec13 is changed to Ser (U13S) was unable to interact with 14-3-3 protein and thus did not inhibit the interaction of 14-3-3 to other target proteins. However, other Cys mutants of SelW(C10S, C33S and C37S) normally interacted with 14-3-3 protein. The interaction of SelW to 14-3-3 protein was enhanced by diamide or H2O2 and decreased by dithiothreitol (DTT). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the Sec of SelW is involved in its interaction with 14-3-3 protein and that this interaction is increased under oxidative stress conditions. Thus, SelW may have a regulatory function in redox cell signaling by interacting with 14-3-3 protein. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In our recent studies, 14-3-3 proteins have been found in the ubiquitinated inclusions inside the anterior horn cells of spinal cords with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To further investigate the role of 14-3-3 proteins in ALS, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of 14-3-3 proteins and compared their distributions with those of SOD1 in FALS patients and SOD1-overexpressing mice. Methods: We examined the postmortem brains and the spinal cords of three FALS cases (A4V SOD1 mutant). Transgenic mice expressing the G93A mutant human SOD1 (mutant SOD1-Tg mice), transgenic mice expressing the wild-type human SOD1 (wild-type SOD1-Tg mice), and non-Tg wild-type mice were also subjected to the immunohistochemical analysis. Results: In all the FALS patients, LBHIs were observed in the cytoplasm of the anterior horn cells, and these inclusions were immunopositive intensely for pan 14-3-3, 14-3-3 beta, and 14-3-3 gamma. In the mutant SOD1-Tg mice, a high degree of immunoreactivity for misfolded SOD1 (C4F6) was observed in the cytoplasm, with an even greater degree of immunoreactivity present in the cytoplasmic aggregates of the anterior horn cells in the lumbar spinal cord. Furthermore, we have found increased 14-3-3 beta and 14-3-3 gamma immunoreactivities in the mutant SOD1-Tg mice. Double immunofluorescent staining showed that C4F6 and 14-3-3 proteins were partially co-localized in the spinal cord with FALS and the mutant SOD1-Tg mice.

Trafficking of organelles (such as Golgi bodies, endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, and mitochondria) and vesicles is essential for plant cell physiology and allows a more or less homogeneous distribution of the cell content. It is well established that the long-range trafficking of organelles is dependent essentially on the network of actin filaments and is powered by the enzyme activity of myosins. However, some lines of evidence suggest that microtubules and members of the kinesin microtubule-based motor superfamily might have a role in the positioning and/or short-range movement of cell organelles and vesicles. Data collected in different cells (such as trichomes and pollen tubes), in specific stages of the plant cell life cycle (for example, during phragmoplast development) and for different organelle classes (mitochondria, Golgi bodies, and chloroplasts) encourage the hypothesis that microtubule-based motors might play subtle yet unclarified roles in organelle trafficking. In some cases, this function could be carried out in cooperation with actin filaments according to the model of ""functional cooperation"" by which motors of different families are associated with the organelle surface.

Plants lacking SCAB1 were hypersensitive to drought stress and exhibited reduced abscisic acid-, H2O2-, and CaCl2-regulated stomatal movement. In vitro and in vivo analyses revealed that SCAB1 binds, stabilizes, and bundles actin filaments. SCAB1 shares sequence similarity only with plant proteins and contains a previously undiscovered actin binding domain. During stomatal closure, actin filaments switched from a radial orientation in open stomata to a longitudinal orientation in closed stomata.

This function is mediated by the attachment of myosin heads to F-actin and the binding of cargo to the tails. Acto-myosin also powers vigorous cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells. Class XI myosins exhibit strikingly fast velocities and may have extraordinary roles in cellular motility. Studies of the structural basis of organelle transport have focused on the cargo-binding tails of myosin XI, revealing a close relationship with the transport of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and Golgi-vesicles. Links between myosin heads and F-actin-based motility have been less investigated. To address this function, we performed localization studies using the head-neck domain of AtMYA2, a myosin XI from Arabidopsis. Results: We expressed the GFP-fused head-neck domain of MYA2 in epidermal cells of various plant species and found that it associated with F-actin. By comparison to other markers such as fimbrin and talin, we revealed that the myosin-labeled F-actin was of a lower quality and absent from the fine microfilament arrays at the cell cortex. However, it colocalized with cytoplasmic (transvacuolar) F-actin in areas coinciding with the tracks of fast organelles. This observation correlates well with the proposed function of myosin XI in organelle trafficking. The fact that organelle streaming was reduced in cells expressing the GFP-MYA2-head6IQ indicated that the functionless motor protein inhibits endogenous myosins. Furthermore, co-expression of the GFP-MYA2-head6IQ with other F-actin markers disrupted its attachment to F-actin. In nuclei, the GFP-myosin associated with short bundles of F-actin. Conclusion: The localization of the head of MYA2 in living plant cells, as investigated here for the first time, suggests a close linkage between this myosin XI and cytoplasmic microfilaments that support the rapid streaming of organelles such as peroxisomes. Potential roles of MYA2 may also exist in the cell nucleus. Whether the low quality of the F-actin-labeling by MYA2-head6IQ compared to other F-actin-binding proteins (ABPs) signifies a weak association of the myosin with actin filaments remains to be proven by other means than in vivo.

Several government reports have highlighted the need for better parenting interventions in at-risk groups. This report was commissioned to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of parenting interventions for children with severe attachment problems (the main review). One supplementary review explored the evaluation of assessment tools and a second reviewed 10-year outcome data to better inform health economic aspects of the main review. Data sources: A total of 29 electronic databases were searched with additional mechanisms for identifying a wide pool of references using the Cochrane methodology. Examples of databases searched include PsycINFO (1806 to January week 1, 2012), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (1946 to December week 4, 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to week 1, 2012). Searches were carried out between 6 and 12 January 2012. Review methods: Papers identified were screened and data were extracted by two independent reviewers, with disagreements arbitrated by a third independent reviewer. Quality assessment tools were used, including quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies - version 2 and the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of parenting interventions was undertaken. A health economics analysis was conducted. Results: The initial search returned 10,167 citations. This yielded 29 RCTs in the main review of parenting interventions to improve attachment patterns, and one involving children with reactive attachment disorder. A meta-analysis of eight studies seeking to improve outcome in at-risk populations showed statistically significant improvement in disorganised attachment. The interventions saw less disorganised attachment at outcome than the control (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.65; p < 0.00001). Much of this focused around interventions improving maternal sensitivity, with or without video feedback. In our first supplementary review, 35 papers evaluated an attachment assessment tool demonstrating validity or psychometric data. Only five reported test-retest data. Twenty-six studies reported inter-rater reliability, with 24 reporting a level of 0.7 or above. Cronbach's alphas were reported in 12 studies for the comparative tests (11 with alpha > 0.7) and four studies for the reference tests (four with alpha > 0.7). Three carried out concurrent validity comparing the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) with another assessment tool. These had good sensitivity but poor specificity. The Disturbances of Attachment Interview had good sensitivity and specificity with the research diagnostic criteria (RDC) for attachment disorders. In our supplementary review of 10-year outcomes in cohorts using a baseline reference standard, two studies were found with disorganised attachment at baseline, with one finding raised psychopathology in adolescence. Budget impact analysis of costs was estimated because a decision model could not be justifiably populated. This, alongside other findings, informed research priorities. Limitations: There are relatively few UK-based clinical trials. A 10-year follow-up, while necessary for our health economists for long-term sequelae, yielded a limited number of papers. Conclusions: Maternal sensitivity interventions show good outcomes in at-risk populations, but require further research with complex children. The SSP and RDC for attachment disorders remain the reference standards for identification until more concurrent and predictive validity research is conducted. A birth cohort with sequential attachment measures and outcomes across different domains is recommended with further, methodologically sound randomised controlled intervention trials.

A role of the GPIb-V-IX complex has long been postulated in view of the decreased prothrombin consumption in Bernard-Soulier patients. We evaluated the impact of GPIb-V-IX deficiency and the requirement for the GPIb alpha extracellular domain. In GPIb beta(-/-) mice, thrombin generation was profoundly decreased in tissue factor- or collagen-related peptide (CRP)-activated platelet-rich plasma and in washed platelets supplemented with normal plasma or with FVa, FXa, and prothrombin. Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure was similarly decreased in response to thrombin, CRP, or CRP + PAR4 peptide despite a normal platelet phospholipid composition. The hypothesis that these defects originate from lack of the GPIb alpha N-terminal domain was evaluated after its removal from normal mouse and human platelets with Nk protease or O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase. Unexpectedly, the treated platelets exhibited normal thrombin generation and PS exposure, indicating that GPIb-V-IX regulates procoagulant activity independently of its GPIb alpha binding region. These results suggested a more general structuring role through intracellular cytoskeleton-anchoring portions regulating responses leading to PS exposure. This hypothesis was supported by the decreased calcium mobilization observed in GPIb beta(-/-) platelets in response to several agonists, some acting independently of GPIb, in contrast to the normal calcium responses in Nk protease-treated platelets.

Here, we investigate the timing, duration, magnitude and regional coherence of the event as expressed in carbonate oxygen-isotope records from three lakes on northwest Europe's Atlantic margin in western Ireland, namely Loch Avolla, Loch Gealain and Lough Corrib. An abrupt negative oxygen-isotope excursion lasted about 200 years. Comparison of records from three sites suggests that the excursion was primarily the result of a reduction of the oxygen-isotope values of precipitation, which was likely caused by lowered air temperatures, possibly coupled with a change in atmospheric circulation. Comparison of records from two of the lakes (Loch Avolla and Loch Gealain), which have differing bathymetries, further suggests a reduction in evaporative loss of lake water during the cooling episode. Comparison of climate model experiments with lake-sediment isotope data indicates that effective moisture may have increased along this part of the northeast Atlantic seaboard during the 8200-year climatic event, as lower evaporation compensated for reduced precipitation.

Previous reviews have highlighted both the ""ideal"" nature of the 8200 yr event as a target for numerical model validation and the likely geographical restriction of the ensuing cold event to the circum-North Atlantic region but have cited a lack of sufficiently resolved palaeoclimatic records to test this hypothesis. We review the current set of high-resolution stable isotope records from multiple archives (lake, bog, marine and ice cores) in the North Atlantic region for the period 9200-7400 yr BP (present = AD 1950). The isotopic values of terrestrial records are closely linked to isotopic values of palaeoprecipitation. All sites provided evidence for at least one centennial-scale anomaly (beginning similar to 8500-8250 yr BP) that exceeded background variability. No evidence for spatial or temporal transgression of the isotope anomalies was identified, implying that a simultaneous climate signal was observed in the circum-North Atlantic region. Comparison with new simulations using the UK Hadley Centre model HadCM3, which was isotope-enabled to simulate changes in the stable isotope composition of precipitation and forced by freshwater input (""hosing"") of 5 Sverdrups (Sv) (0.005 km(3)/s), for 1 yr, indicated agreement with the observed decrease in the amplitude of the isotope anomaly with distance from the NW North Atlantic. The model-simulated duration of the event, however, was consistently shorter than that observed in palaeoclimatic records. A review of evidence for forcing additional to the catastrophic release of meltwater from Lake Agassiz (solar variability, sea-ice feedback and longer-term meltwater history) suggested that reduced solar output did not directly coincide with the 8200 yr event, but that a more complex history of meltwater discharges and sea-ice feedback may have conditioned the AMOC for sustained climatic impact.

We also used the resulting phylogenetic data in combination with morphological/anatomical evidence to re-evaluate the taxonomic status of 'hydrobioid' family-level groups. Our results indicate that all three of the alignment strategies that were used resulted in phylogenies having similar signal levels.

Moreover, the set of 'standard' gastropod genes supported recognition of many previously recognized families and provides new insight into the systematics of several problematic groups.

Biochemical studies using muscle extracts from transgenic mice overexpressing CAPN3 or its inactive mutant revealed that CaM binding enhanced CAPN3 autolytic activation.

Nonetheless, a specific requirement for these proteases in the progression of skeletal muscle atrophy has not been demonstrated. Therefore, this investigation determined whether calpains or caspase-3 is required for oxidant-induced C2C12 myotube atrophy. We demonstrate that exposure to hydrogen peroxide (25 mu M H(2)O(2)) induces myotube oxidative damage and atrophy, with no evidence of cell death. Twenty-four hours of exposure to H(2)O(2) significantly reduced both myotube diameter and the abundance of numerous proteins, including myosin (-81%), alpha-actinin (-40%), desmin (-79%), talin (-37%), and troponin I (-80%). Myotube atrophy was also characterized by increased cleavage of the cysteine protease substrate alpha II-spectrin following 4 h and 24 h of H(2)O(2) treatment. This degradation was blocked by administration of the protease inhibitor leupeptin (10 mu M). Using small interfering RNA transfection of mature myotubes against the specific proteases calpain-1, calpain-2, and caspase-3, we demonstrated that calpain-1 is required for H(2)O(2)-induced myotube atrophy.

Results: Four peptides derived from the MDV glycoprotein gH (gHH1, gHH2, gHH3, and gHH5) and one peptide derived from gB (gBH1) could efficiently inhibit plaque formation in primary chicken embryo fibroblast cells (CEFs) with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of below 12 mu M.

Twenty-four hours after injury, 5 x 105 green fluorescent protein-labeled MSCs in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS alone (sham) were injected into the anal sphincter for i.m. treatment; i.v. and sham i.v. treatments were delivered daily for 6 consecutive days via the tail vein. Anal pressures were recorded before injury and 10 days and 5 weeks after treatment. Ten days after i.m. MSC treatment, resting and peak pressures were significantly increased compared with those in sham i.m. treatment (p < .001). When compared with the NI group, the injury groups had anal pressures that were not significantly different 5 weeks after i.m./i.v. treatment. Both resting and peak pressures were also significantly increased after i.m./i.v. MSC treatment compared with treatment with PBS (p < .001), suggesting recovery. Statistical analysis was done using paired t test with Bonferroni correction. Marked decrease in fibrosis and scar tissue was seen in both MSC-treated groups. Both i.m. and i.v. MSC treatment after injury caused an increase in anal pressures sustained at 5 weeks, although fewer cells were injected i.m.

This transient reduction should be regulated by inflammatory mediators, which are responsible for the fine-tuning of the process. In the present study, we measured the pre-and postoperative serum concentrations of melatonin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and cortisol in women who underwent an elective hysterectomy and correlated the variation in melatonin with postoperative pain. Methods: We evaluated 12 women who had an abdominal hysterectomy. Blood was collected at 10.00 and 22.00 h 1 week and 1 day before the surgery, on the 1st and 2nd days after the surgery and at 22.00 h on the day of the surgery. Results: On the night after the surgery, there was no melatonin detected at 22.00 h. High TNF levels were accompanied by a lower nocturnal melatonin output, higher postoperative pain according to a visual analog scale and the request of higher doses of analgesics. In addition, low cortisol levels were accompanied by a lower nocturnal melatonin output. Conclusion: Our results confirm that the same antagonistic pattern between TNF and glucocorticoids observed in cultured pineal glands also occurs in humans. This integrative pattern suggests that the cross talk between the immune and endocrine system orchestrates longitudinal changes in pineal activity, reinforcing the hypothesis of an immune-pineal axis.

Influenza vim is an enveloped virus that contains a segmented negative strand RNA genome. Assembly and budding of progeny influenza virions is a complex, multi-step process that occurs in lipid raft domains on the apical membrane of infected cells. The viral proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are targeted to lipid rafts, causing the coalescence and enlargement of the raft domains. This clustering of HA and NA may cause a deformation of the membrane and the initiation of the virus budding event. M1 is then thought to bind to the cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA where it can then polymerize and form the interior structure of the emerging virion. M1, bound to the cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA, additionally serves as a docking site for the recruitment of the viral RNPs and may mediate the recruitment of M2 to the site of virus budding. M2 initially stabilizes the site of budding, possibly enabling the polymerization of the matrix protein and the formation of filamentous virions. Subsequently. M2 is able to alter membrane curvature at the neck of the budding virus, causing membrane scission and the release of the progeny virion. This review investigates the latest research on influenza virus budding in an attempt to provide a step-by-step analysis of the assembly and budding processes for influenza viruses.

However, confocal microscopy of infected cells showed no marked colocalisation between M1 and VPS28 or VPS4 ESCRT proteins, or relocalisation of the cellular proteins. Trafficking of HA and M1 appeared normal when endosomal sorting was impaired by expression of inactive VPS4. Overexpression of either isoform of VPS28 or wildtype or dominant negative VPS4 proteins did not alter production of filamentous virions. SiRNA depletion of endogenous VPS28 had no significant effect on influenza virus replication. Furthermore, cells expressing wildtype or dominant-negative VPS4 replicated filamentous and non-filamentous strains of influenza to similar titres, indicating that influenza release is VPS4-independent.

The VLP system was used to address the identity of the minimal set of viral proteins required for budding. Combinations of viral proteins were expressed in cells, and the polypeptide composition of the particles released into the culture media was analyzed. Contrary to previous findings in which matrix (MI) protein was considered to be the driving force of budding because M1 was found to be released copiously into the culture medium when M1 was expressed by using the vaccinia virus T7 RNA polymerase-driven overexpression system, in our noncytotoxic VLP system M1 was not released efficiently into the culture medium. Additionally, hemagglutinin (HA), when treated with exogenous neuraminidase (NA) or coexpressed with viral NA, could be released from cells independently of MI. Incorporation of M1 into VLPs required RA expression, although when M1 was omitted from VLPs, particles with morphologies similar to those of wild-type VLPs or viruses were observed. Furthermore, when HA and NA cytoplasmic tail mutants were included in the VLPs, M1 failed to be efficiently incorporated into VLPs, consistent with a model in which the glycoproteins control virus budding by sorting to lipid raft microdomains and recruiting the internal viral core components.

After decades of use of the first generation immunosuppressives, with their associated increased risks of infections, tumours and other side effects, costimulation blockade was proposed in the nineties as a more specific method of immunosuppression. In vitro experiments indicated that costimulation blockade induced a population of anergic cells in mice, humans and in non-human primates. The rediscovery of a suppressor cell population, the naturally occurring regulatory T-cells (Tregs), raised the question whether the anergic cells induced by costimulation blockade were also naturally occurring Tregs and whether Tregs were important for the immunosuppressive effect of costimulation blockade. The effect of costimulation blockade on Tregs is not completely clear, but soon it became evident that costimulation blockade and Tregs can benefit from each other, although they act via different mechanisms. Optimal suppression is only obtained when costimulation blockade and Tregs are both present. In vivo experiments in rodents demonstrated that costimulation blockade could induce permanent graft survival. When translated to primates, costimulation blockade proved to be less successful for the induction of tolerance. The complicating factor proved to be the presence of memory T-cells induced by viral infections, which cross-react with allo-antigens, the so-called heterologous immunity. Virus-induced T-cells are absent in specific-pathogen free raised mice, whereas primates have substantial numbers of allo-antigen crossreactive memory T-cells. These memory T-cells are less dependent on costimulation blockade compared with the naive T-cells present in specific pathogen free mice. The focus of tolerance research has therefore shifted to Tregs. Currently, no marker is available that reliably identifies Tregs in humans. FOXP3 seems to be associated with Tregs, but is not exclusively correlated with a regulatory function of the cells in human and non-human primates. Identification of Tregs should therefore be based on functional parameters. Before Tregs can be used for the induction of tolerance in transplant or auto-immune patients, evaluation of the use of Tregs is needed in a relevant pre-clinical model. At the Biomedical Primate Research Centre, we have a long-standing experience with treatments that prolong tissue and organ allograft survival. A large number of treatments were evaluated in the rhesus monkey model of kidney and skin transplantation. Recently, we have characterized naturally occurring Tregs of the rhesus monkey. This will allow for the evaluation of protocols that either induce Tregs in vivo, and of protocols that use ex vivo induced and/or expanded Tregs.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"978-1-60692-102-9",NA,NA,NA,2009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","43",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000269529300001",NA,156,"156 no 2"

Although the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle and other species with which humans have frequent contact is high, human infections are relatively uncommon, despite a low infectious dose. A plausible explanation for the low disease incidence is the possibility that not all strains are virulent in humans. If there are substantial differences in virulence among strains in nature, then human disease may select for high virulence. We used a gnotobiotic piglet model to investigate the virulence of isolates from healthy cattle and from humans in disease outbreaks and to determine the correlation between production of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Stx2 and virulence. Overall, E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from healthy cattle were less virulent in gnotobiotic piglets than strains isolated from humans during disease outbreaks.

RESULTS: Physiological profiling using a series of biotests and metabolic profiling in treated duckweed (Lemna paucicostata L.) suggested a common mode of action for the herbicides. Symptoms of growth inhibition and photobleaching of new fronds in Lemna were accompanied with metabolite changes indicating an upregulation of shikimate and tyrosine metabolism, paralleled by decreased plastoquinone and carotenoid synthesis. Supplying Lemna with 10 mu M of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4-HPP) reversed phytotoxic effects of cinmethylin and isoxazolines to a great extent, whereas the addition of L-tyrosine was ineffective. It was hypothesised that the herbicides block the conversion of tyrosine to 4-HPP, catalysed by tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), in the prenylquinone pathway which provides plastoquinone, a cofactor of phytoene desaturase in carotenoid synthesis. Accordingly, enhanced resistance to ISO1 treatment was observed in Arabidopsis thaliana L. mutants, which overexpress the yeast prephenate dehydrogenase in plastids as a TAT bypass. In addition, the herbicides were able to inhibit TAT7 activity in vitro for the recombinant enzyme of A. thaliana. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that TAT7 or another TAT isoenzyme is the putative target of the herbicides.

The difficulty with the alternative statistical approach, where none of the suggested candidates has been functionally validated, may partly be due to the posited genetic architecture of the common epilepsies, such as the idiopathic generalized epilepsies. A subset of both rare and common variants from a much larger pool of susceptibility genes may contribute to disease risk. We review methods and designs for the genetic dissection of common epilepsies. Recent findings Genetic association studies, though theoretically more powerful than linkage analysis, have not yet delivered validated susceptibility genes. Methodological flaws can undermine such studies but are correctable. Concerns remain, however, about the extent of underlying genetic heterogeneity in common epilepsies. Genome-wide association studies are increasingly feasible, but issues remain about their conduct and analysis. Metaanalysis may resolve conflicting association studies, facilitated by the establishment of databases of genetic association studies. Newer multi-locus and admixture mapping approaches are attractive alternatives to traditional association studies and may offer new insights into identifying epilepsy genes.

To gain insight into the mechanism of action of nTregs in pathological and physiological immune responses, it is important to analyze bioactive molecules that modulate the maintenance and function of nTregs. From a library of bioactive lipids, we obtained lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) as a molecule that enhanced the Foxp3 expression and suppressive function of human nTregs significantly in comparison with those of DMSO-treated nTregs (control). The expression levels of TGF-beta 1 mRNA and protein in LPC-treated nTregs were significantly higher than those in control nTregs. After treatment with anti-TGF-beta 1 antibody, the increases in Foxp3 expression and the suppressive properties of LPC-treated nTregs returned to the levels observed in control nTregs. These findings indicate that LPC enhances Foxp3 expression and the suppressive function of nTregs through TGF-beta 1 produced by nTregs themselves. Experimental knockdown of G2A and GPR4 showed that this LPC-induced TGF-beta 1 expression in nTregs was due to G2A signaling, and did not involve GPR4. Moreover, JNK was a major contributor to LPC-induced TGF-beta 1 expression in nTregs, although LPC activated MAPKs including ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK via G2A. LPC is a bioactive lysolipid highly abundant in the circulation. Therefore, LPC may contribute to the maintenance and function of human nTregs in vivo. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Proton-sensing GPCRs, including OGR1, GPR4, G2A, and TDAG8, are fully activated at pH 6.4-6.8 in vitro. To understand whether the proton-sensing GPCRs are expressed in nociceptors, we cloned the four mouse genes and examined their tissue distribution and localization in pain-relevant loci, the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). The OGR1 family members were widely expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Their transcripts were expressed in the DRG, and most (75-82%) were present in small-diameter neurons responsible for nociception. Approximately 31-40% of total DRG neurons expressed at least two proton-sensing GPCRs. We have also demonstrated that gene expression of proton-sensing GPCRs is changed in ASIC3 knockout mice.

We further show that miR-223 is a negative regulator of the Roquin ubiquitin ligase, Roquin curtails IL-17A synthesis, and the 3' untranslated region of Roquin is a target for miR-223, thus defining a molecular pathway by which IL-10 modulates IL-17-mediated inflammation. To identify additional miRNAs that may be involved in the regulation of Roquin, transcriptome analysis was done using cDNAs from He La cells transfected with 90 miRNA mimics.

Stx occurs in 2 types, Stx1 and Stx2. B subunits of either type stimulate von Willebrand factor (VWF) secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and Stx2B can cause thrombotic microangiopathy in Adamts13(-/-) mice. We have now deter-mined that Stx1B and Stx2B activate different signaling pathways in HUVECs. VWF secretion induced by Stx1B is associated with a transient rise in intracellular Ca2+ level that is blocked by chelation with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester, removal of extracellular Ca2+, the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, or small interfering RNA knockdown of protein kinase C alpha. In contrast, Stx2B-induced VWF secretion is associated with activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and is blocked by the PKA inhibitor H89 or small interfering RNA knockdown of PKA. Stx2B does not increase cAMP levels and may activate PKA by a cAMP-independent mechanism. The activation of distinct signaling pathways may be relevant to understanding why E coli that express Stx2 are more likely to cause D+HUS than are E coli expressing only Stx1.

Tissue samples of normal colon, benign adenomas, colorectal carcinomas, and liver metastases from 111 patients were obtained for the quantification of the expression of the cellular STxB receptor, the glycosphingolipid globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb(3) or CD77).

Of a given tumor sample, on average, 80% of the cells could visibly bind STxB, and upon incubation at 37 degrees C, STxB was transported to the Golgi apparatus, following the retrograde route. This STxB-specific intracellular targeting allows the molecule to avoid recycling and degradation, and STxB could consequently be detected on tumor cells even 5 days after initial uptake.

Although the mechanisms involved in cardiomyopathy are poorly defined, a role for direct retroviral action and/or focal infiltration of activated immune cells have been postulated. Here we investigated mechanisms in retrovirus associated cardiomyopathy using a well-defined mouse model of acquired immunodeficiency. Methods: Mice were dosed with LPBM5 retrovirus; cardiac performance was assessed by echocardiography followed by tissue collection at 5 and 10 weeks post-infection. Results: Contractile deficits were observed at 5 and 10 weeks post-retrovirus infection and preceded the development of overt immunodeficiency. Selective and widespread cardiac infiltration of CD68+ cells, but not neutrophils, mast cells, or eosinophils was also observed at both 5 and 10 weeks. LPBM5 retrovirus was readily detectable in cardiac samples by RT-PCR. Time dependent increases in cardiac protein nitration (biomarker of reactive nitrogen species) were observed and were correlated to the extent of cardiac dysfunction whereas no changes in NOSH occurred at 5 and 10 weeks. We corroborated the mouse findings using cardiac tissues and clinical findings from human HIV/AIDS autopsies. Conclusions: These studies demonstrated that cardiac myocyte protein nitration in AIDS related cardiomyopathies, rather than focal immune cell lesions characterize retrovirus associated cardiomyopathies and differentiate them from non-retroviral cardiomyopathies.

This investigation is intended to estimate the annual soil loss in Wadi Kerak watershed, and to examine the spatial patterns of soil loss and intensity, as an essential procedure for proper planning of conservation measures. To achieve these objectives, the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model has been applied in a geographical information system framework. After computing the RUSLE parameters (R, K, LS, C and P) soil erosion risk and intensity maps were generated, then integrated with physical factors (terrain units, elevation, slope, and land uses/cover) to explore the influence of these factors on the spatial patterns of soil erosion loss. The estimated potential annual average soil loss is 64 ton ha(-1)year(-1), and the potential erosion rates from calculated class ranges from 0.0 to 790 ton ha(-1)year(-1). Soil erosion risk assessment indicates that 54.5 % of the catchment is prone to high to extreme soil losses higher than 25 ton ha(-1)year(-1). The lower and middle parts of the catchment suffer from high, severe, to extreme soil erosion. While 45.5 % of the basin still undergoes slight and moderate levels of soil loss of less than 25 ton ha(-1)year(-1), yet 76.91 % of soil erosion occurred on four different terrain units, and 72.29 % of soil erosion occurred in zones less than 600 m in elevation, with 88 % present on areas of 0A degrees aEuro""6A degrees, 5A degrees aEuro""15A degrees, and 15A degrees aEuro""25A degrees slope categories. 32.6, 30.3, and 33.1 % of soil erosion occurred on rainfed mixed farming and irrigated areas, barren, and rangeland, respectively.

Meta-analysis of trials that provided sufficient information. Data sources PubMed and Embase from inception to April 2013. Eligibility for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of autologous bone marrow stem cells for heart disease on mean left ventricular ejection fraction. Results There were over 600 discrepancies in 133 reports from 49 trials. There was a significant association between the number of discrepancies and the reported increment in EF with bone marrow stem cell therapy (Spearman's r=0.4, P=0.005). Trials with no discrepancies were a small minority (five trials) and showed a mean EF effect size of -0.4%. The 24 trials with 1-10 discrepancies showed a mean effect size of 2.1%.

The high concordance rate between monozygotic twins supports a strong genetic component. Among the most promising candidate genes for ASD is the SHANK gene family, including SHANK1, SHANK2 (ProSAP1), and SHANK3 (ProSAP2). SHANK genes are therefore important candidates for modeling ASD in mice and various genetic models were generated within the last few years. As the diagnostic criteria for ASD are purely behaviorally defined, the validity of mouse models for ASD strongly depends on their behavioral phenotype. Behavioral phenotyping is therefore a key component of the current translational approach and requires sensitive behavioral test paradigms with high relevance to each diagnostic symptom category. While behavioral phenotyping assays for social deficits and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities are well-established, the development of sensitive behavioral test paradigms to assess communication deficits in mice is a daunting challenge. Measuring ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) appears to be a promising strategy. In the first part of the review, an overview on the different types of mouse USV and their communicative functions will be provided. The second part is devoted to studies on the emission of USV in Shank mouse models for ASD. Evidence for communication deficits was obtained in Shank1, Shank2, and Shank3 genetic mouse models for ASD, often paralleled by behavioral phenotypes relevant to social deficits seen in ASD.

Postnatal brains appear to exhibit stimulus-induced methylation changes because of factors such as environment, lifestyle, and diet (nutrition). The purpose of this study was to examine how extensively the brain DNA methylome is regulated by nutrition in early life. Results: By quantifying the total amount of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in the thalamus and the hippocampus of postnatal malnourished mice and normal mice, we found the two regions showed differences in global DNA methylation status. The methylation level in the thalamus was much higher than that in the hippocampus. Then, we used a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based method (MSCC) to detect the whole genome methylation of the two regions in malnourished mice and normal mice. Notably, we found that in the thalamus, 500 discriminable variations existed and that approximately 60% were related to neuronal development or psychiatric diseases.

This multicenter, randomized, phase III study investigated the efficacy of figitumumab plus erlotinib compared with erlotinib alone in patients with pretreated, nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and methods: Patients (stage IIIB/IV or recurrent disease with nonadenocarcinoma histology) who had previously received at least one platinum-based regimen were randomized to receive open-label figitumumab (20 mg/kg) plus erlotinib 150 mg/day or erlotinib alone every 3 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Results: Of 583 patients randomized, 579 received treatment. The study was closed early by an independent data safety monitoring committee due to results crossing the prespecified futility boundary. At the final analysis, median OS was 5.7 months for figitumumab plus erlotinib and 6.2 months for erlotinib alone [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-1.31; P = 0.35]. Median progression-free survival was 2.1 months for figitumumab plus erlotinib and 2.6 months for erlotinib alone (HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90-1.29; P = 0.43). Treatment-related nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 18% and 5% of patients in the figitumumab arm or erlotinib alone arm, respectively.

This was tempered by concerns about toxicity to normal tissue IGF-1R and cross-reactivity with insulin receptor (InsR). In fact, toxicity is not a show-stopper; the key issue is efficacy. While IGF-1R inhibition induces responses as monotherapy in sarcomas and with chemotherapy or targeted agents in common cancers, negative Phase 2/3 trials in unselected patients prompted the cessation of several Pharma programs. Here, we review completed and on-going trials of IGF-1R antibodies, kinase inhibitors and ligand antibodies. We assess candidate biomarkers for patient selection, highlighting the potential predictive value of circulating IGFs/IGFBPs, the need for standardized assays for 1GF-1R, and preclinical evidence that variant InsRs mediate resistance to IGF-1R antibodies. We review hypothesis-led and unbiased approaches to evaluate IGF-1R inhibitors with other agents, and stress the need to consider sequencing with chemotherapy. The last few years were a tough time for IGF-1R therapeutics, but also brought progress in understanding IGF biology. Even failed studies include patients who derived benefit; they should be investigated to identify features distinguishing the tumors and host environment of responders from non-responders. We emphasize the importance of incorporating biospecimen collection into trial design, and wording patient consents to allow post hoc analysis of trial material as new data become available. Such information represents the key to unlocking the potential of this approach, to inform the next generation of trials of IGF signalling inhibitors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to synthesize the evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of oral mechanical bowel preparation versus no preparation or enema. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and CINAHL without any language restrictions (last search on September 6, 2013). We also searched the US Food and Drug Administration Web site and ClinicalTrials.gov and supplemented our searches by asking technical experts and perusing reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: We included English-language, full-text reports of randomized clinical trials and nonrandomized comparative studies of patients undergoing elective colon or rectal surgery. For adverse events we also included single-group cohort studies of at least 200 participants. INTERVENTIONS: Interventions included oral mechanical bowel preparation, oral mechanical bowel preparation plus enema, enema only, and no oral mechanical bowel preparation or enema. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anastomotic leakage, all-cause mortality, wound infection, peritonitis/intra-abdominal abscess, reoperation, surgical site infection, quality of life, length of stay, and adverse events were measured. We synthesized results across studies qualitatively and with Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: A total of 18 randomized clinical trials, 7 nonrandomized comparative studies, and 6 single-group cohorts were included. In meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials, the credibility intervals of the summary OR included the null value of 1.0 for comparisons of oral mechanical bowel preparation and either no oral preparation or enema for overall mortality, anastomotic leakage, wound infection, peritonitis, surgical site infection, and reoperation. These results were robust to extensive sensitivity analyses. Evidence on adverse events was sparse. LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by weaknesses in the underlying evidence, such as incomplete reporting of relevant information, exclusion of non-English and relevant unpublished studies, and possible missed indexing of nonrandomized studies.

In contrast, studies in mice suggested that in the presence of high IgE levels, IL-33 triggers degranulation and anaphylaxis of similar severity as specific allergen. Consistent with this view, sera of atopic patients contain elevated levels of IL-33 after anaphylaxis. In this study, we determined whether IL-33 is potentially anaphylactogenic in humans with high IgE levels by regulating exocytosis independent of Fc epsilon RI cross-linking. Furthermore, we investigated whether IL-33 is released upon allergen provocation in vivo. MethodsIn subjects with high serum IgE levels, we measured IL-33-induced histamine/LTC(4)in vitro, CD63 translocation ex vivo, and responsiveness of mast cells in vivo by skin prick test (SPT). In asthma patients, release of IL-33 and its correlation with early (tryptase)- and late-phase markers (IL-13 levels, eosinophil numbers) of the allergic response were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) after allergen challenge. ResultsIL-33 itself does not trigger basophil degranulation in vitro and ex vivo, even in subjects with high serum IgE levels, and negative SPTs demonstrate that skin mast cells do not degranulate in response to IL-33. However, in response to allergen challenge, IL-33 is rapidly released into BALFs at levels that do not correlate with other immediate- and late-phase parameters. ConclusionIL-33 is unlikely an independent trigger of anaphylaxis even in subjects with high IgE levels.

MAP4Ks including MAP4K1/HPK1, MAP4K2/GCK, MAP4K3/GLK, MAP4K4/HGK, MAP4K5/KHS, and MAP4K6/MINK have been reported to induce JNK activation through activating the MAP3K-MAP2K cascade. The physiological roles of MAP4Ks in immunity and inflammation are largely unknown until recent studies using biochemical approaches and knockout mice. Surprisingly, JNK is not the major target of MAP4Ks in immune cells; MAP4Ks regulate immune responses through novel targets. HPK1 inhibits T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and B-cell receptor signaling via inducing phosphorylation/ubiquitination of SLP-76 and BLNK, respectively. GLK activates TCR signaling through phosphorylating/activating PKC theta. T-cell-mediated immune responses and Th17-mediated experimental autoimmune diseases are enhanced in HPK1 knockout mice but ameliorated in GLK knockout mice. Consistently, HPK1 levels are decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and T cells from patients with psoriatic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), respectively. Moreover, GLK levels are increased in T cells frompatients with SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, or adult-onset Still's disease; the percentages of GLK-overexpression T cells are correlated with the disease activity. In addition, HGK phosphorylates and induces TRAF2 protein degradation, leading to negative regulation of IL-6 production in resting T cells. Loss of HGK in T cells results in spontaneous systemic inflammation and type 2 diabetes in mice. HGK is also involved in cancer cell migration. To date, the phenotypes of knockout mice for GCK, KHS, and MINK have not been reported; the roles of these threeMAP4Ks in immune cell signaling are discussed in this review.

GAS6 encodes a secreted protein involved in physiological processes including cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and cell survival. We performed immunohistochemistry on various ovarian cancer tissues and found that GAS6 expression was elevated in tumour tissue samples compared to healthy control samples (P < 0.0001).

The interest of the scientific community in identifying best approaches to develop such prediction models was reaffirmed in a competition style international collaboration called IMPROVER Diagnostic Signature Challenge whose results we describe herein. Results: Fifty-four teams used public data to develop prediction models in four disease areas including multiple sclerosis, lung cancer, psoriasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and made predictions on blinded new data that we generated. Teams were scored using three metrics that captured various aspects of the quality of predictions, and best performers were awarded. This article presents the challenge results and introduces to the community the approaches of the best overall three performers, as well as an R package that implements the approach of the best overall team. The analyses of model performance data submitted in the challenge as well as additional simulations that we have performed revealed that (i) the quality of predictions depends more on the disease endpoint than on the particular approaches used in the challenge; (ii) the most important modeling factor (e. g. data preprocessing, feature selection and classifier type) is problem dependent; and (iii) for optimal results datasets and methods have to be carefully matched.

The recurrence of HCC after curative treatments is currently a major hurdle. Identification of subsets of patients with distinct prognosis provides an opportunity to tailor therapeutic approaches as well as to select the patients with specific sub-phenotypes for targeted therapy. Thus, the development of gene expression profiles to improve the prediction of HCC prognosis is important for HCC management. Although several gene signatures have been evaluated for the prediction of HCC prognosis, there is no consensus on the predictive power of these signatures. Using systematic approaches to evaluate these signatures and combine them with clinicopathologic information may provide more accurate prediction of HCC prognosis. Recently, Villanueva et al([3]) developed a composite prognostic model incorporating gene expression patterns in both tumor and adjacent tissues to predict HCC recurrence. In this commentary, we summarize the current progress in using gene signatures to predict HCC prognosis, and discuss the importance, existing issues and future research directions in this field.

This has led to a series of measurements by fluorescence microscopy of single dsDNA molecules under confinement to nanofluidic slits. Despite the efforts expended on such experiments and the corresponding theory and simulations of confined polymers, a consistent description of changes of the radius of gyration of dsDNA under strong confinement has not yet emerged. Here, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify relevant factors that might account for this inconsistency. Our simulations indicate a significant amplification of excluded volume interactions under confinement at the nanoscale due to the reduction of the effective dimensionality of the system. Thus, any factor influencing the excluded volume interaction of dsDNA, such as ionic strength, solution chemistry, and even fluorescent labels, can greatly influence the dsDNA size under strong confinement. These factors, which are normally less important in bulk solutions of dsDNA at moderate ionic strengths because of the relative weakness of the excluded volume interaction, must therefore be under tight control to achieve reproducible measurements of dsDNA under conditions of dimensional reduction. By simulating semi-flexible polymers over a range of parameter values relevant to the experimental systems and exploiting past theoretical treatments of the dimensional variation of swelling exponents and prefactors, we have developed a novel predictive relationship for the in-plane radius of gyration of long semi-flexible polymers under slit-like confinement.

This system requires strict control both at the level of the generation the cells carrying these receptors and at the level of their activation and effector function mediation in order to avoid autoimmunity and mitigate immune pathology. Thus, quality control checkpoints are built into the system at multiple nodes in the response, relying on clonal selection and regulatory networks to maximize pathogen-directed effects and minimize collateral tissue damage. However, these checkpoints are compromised with age, resulting in poorer immune control manifesting as tissue-damaging autoimmune and inflammatory phenomena which can cause widespread systemic disease, paradoxically compounding the problems associated with increased susceptibility to infectious disease and possibly cancer in the elderly. Better understanding the reasons for slippage of immune control will pave the way for developing rational strategies for interventions to maintain appropriate immunity while reducing immunopathology.

Interestingly, epigenetic changes can be triggered by environmental factors. Environmental exposure to e.g. metals, persistent organic pollutants or endocrine disrupting chemicals has been shown to modulate epigenetic marks, not only in mammalian cells or rodents, but also in environmentally relevant species such as fish or water fleas. The associated changes in gene expression often lead to modifications in the affected organism's phenotype. Epigenetic changes can in some cases be transferred to subsequent generations, even when these generations are no longer exposed to the external factor which induced the epigenetic change, as observed in a study with fungicide exposed rats. The possibility of this phenomenon in other species was demonstrated in water fleas exposed to the epigenetic drug 5-azacytidine. This way, populations can experience the effects of their ancestors' exposure to chemicals, which has implications for environmental risk assessment.

Recent genome-wide association studies have identified association between common genetic variants and complex phenotype; however, the minimal effect sizes observed in such studies highlight the potential for other causal factors to be involved in phenotypic variation. The epigenetic state of an organism (or 'epigenome') incorporates a landscape of complex and plastic molecular events that may underlie the 'missing link' that integrates genotype with phenotype. The nature of these processes has been the subject of intense scientific study over the recent years, and characterisation of epigenetic variation, in the form of 'epialleles', is providing fascinating insight into how the genome functions within a range of developmental processes, environments, and in states of health and disease. This review will discuss how and when mammalian epialleles may be generated and their interaction with genetic and environmental factors. We will outline how an epiallele has a variable relationship with phenotype, and how new technologies may be used for their detection and to facilitate an understanding of their contribution to phenotype.

Digitally adjustment of the mixing ratios of the building blocks on the DMDG chip allowed us to rapidly scan a variety of synthesis conditions without consuming significant amounts of reagents. Nearly uniform SNPs with sizes ranging from 35 to 350 nm were obtained and characterized by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering.

For qPCR, sensitivity depends on target type (i.e. fusion transcript, mutated gene or even overexpressed gene) and in the case of overexpressed genes on expression in healthy haematopoiesis. For MFC, sensitivity is likewise largely a function on whether the same phenotype is seen in normal immature cells and, in addition, antigen drift/shift with LAIPs changing at relapse is a well-known problem.

We geochemically explore the factors causing the spatial variability in an alluvial plain that is mainly used for rice cultivation, the commonest land-use pattern in alluvial plains of Asia. We investigate the chemical processes, sources of chemicals that affect the behavior of As, and their relationships with the geologic conditions at seven multilevel sampler sites. All sites showed As concentrations that increased with depth at shallow levels and decreased at greater depths, which is the typical vertical pattern in alluvial aquifers where Fe-(hydr)oxide reduction is the major As release mechanism. Data show that NO(3) and SO(4) originating from the land surface play important roles in suppressing the increase in As concentration by buffering the redox potential at shallow depths and by precipitating As with sulfide minerals at deep depths, respectively. The As concentration in the intermediate depth range was also low in the presence of SO(4), because its reduction can occur together with Fe-(hydr)oxide reduction in a wide range of redox potentials. As a result, the maximum As concentrations at the sites where the land was covered with a thick silt layer (similar to 5 m) were 3- to 5-times higher than those at other sites due to the supply of NO(3) and SO(4) from land surface being largely limited by the silt layer. This indicates that the surface geology could be an important indicator for the As concentration in alluvial groundwater. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The disposal site was in operation from 1983 until 1994 and was covered with 0.3-0.5 m thick soils in 2001 when this study was initiated. Sequential extraction analyses and batch leaching experiments were also performed using the coal ash samples collected from the disposal site. The results suggest the important roles of siderite (FeCO(3)) precipitation/dissolution and soil cover, which have been ignored previously. Arsenic levels in the porewater were very low (average of 10 mu g L(-1)) when the site was covered with soil due to coprecipitation with siderite. The soil cover enabled the creation of anoxic conditions, which raised the Fe concentration by the reductive dissolution of Fe-(hydr)oxides. Because of the high alkalinity generated from the alkaline coal ash, even a small increase in the Fe concentration (0.66 mg L(-1) on average) could cause siderite precipitation. When the soil cover was removed. however, an oxidizing condition was created and triggered the precipitation of dissolved Fe as (hydr)oxides. As a result, the dissolution of previously precipitated As-rich siderite caused higher As concentration in the porewater (average of 345 mu g L(-1)). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Geriatric horses defined as horses above the age of 20, exhibit a decline in body condition, muscle tone and general well-being. It is not known whether these changes contribute to decreased immune function or are the result of declining immune function. Geriatric years are characterized by increased susceptibility to infections and a reduced antibody response to vaccination as a result of changes in the immune system. Humans and horses share many of these age-related changes, with only a few differences. Thus, inflamm-aging and immunosenescence are well-described phenomena in both human and equine research, particularly in relation to the peripheral blood and especially the T-cell compartment. However, the lung is faced with unique challenges because of its constant interaction with the external environment and thus may not share similarities to peripheral blood when considering age-related changes in immune function. Indeed, recent studies have shown discrepancies in cytokine mRNA and protein expression between the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage immune cells. These results provide important evidence that age-related immune changes or 'dys-functions' are organ-specific. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This means that a perturbed analysis can be used as a reliable proxy for the truth.

Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is a rare necrotizing vasculitis associated with asthma, blood and tissue eosinophilia and granuloma formation. We wondered whether eosinophil accumulation in CSS results from the defect of intrinsic apoptosis pathway in blood eosinophils, leading to their prolonged survival. Methods. We analysed immunophenotype (flow cytometry), expression of apoptosis-related genes (real-time PCR) and spontaneous apoptosis in blood eosinophils isolated from nine patients in exacerbation (active CSS), seven patients in remission (inactive CSS) and 14 matched healthy subjects. Serum IL-5 levels were also measured. Results. In active CSS, blood eosinophils were characterized by small (< 2-fold) decrease in expression of a few genes, primarily proapoptotic (e.g. BCL2L13, CASP2, CARD4) or involved in regulation of NF-kappa B (IKBKB, REL), but they did not differ in the rate of spontaneous apoptosis, when compared with other groups. Only selected genes were positively (BNIPL, PYCARD, CASP8, CRADD, BCAP31), or negatively (IKBKE) correlated with disease activity. In active CSS, eosinophils expressed activation markers (CD69, CD25), especially in subjects with most severe disease and elevated serum IL-5. Conclusions. High susceptibility of peripheral blood eosinophils to spontaneous apoptosis in vitro, and minor changes in expression of apoptotic-related genes in transcriptome analysis, do not support the hypothesis on intrinsic defect in apoptosis, as the cause of eosinophil accumulation in CSS.",NA,NA,NA,"Szczeklik, Wojciech/N-8096-2014;","Szczeklik, Wojciech/0000-0002-1349-1123; Sanak, Marek/0000-0001-7635-8103",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1462-0324",NA,NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2009,"48","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1202","1207",NA,"10.1093/rheumatology/kep209",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000270267600006",19643727,224,"224 no 1"

If authorship attribution is incorrect, the wrong people may take the creditor the blame. Correct authorship of medical papers is also important because the research and publication process relies on trust. If scientists or clinicians are prepared to lie about who was involved with a research project why should we believe their findings? Groups of journal editors, notably the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, have tried to establish criteria for authorship but these are not universally accepted. Despite the lack of agreement, authorship of journal articles continues to be the basis for academic appointments and is used to measure the research output of departments and therefore determine future funding. Some journals have started to use contributor lists, indicating the role of each individual, in place of, or in addition to, traditional lists of authors. However, problems about the threshold of involvement that merits authorship, and the order of listing remain unresolved. Journal editors are usually unable to adjudicate on authorship disputes since detailed, local knowledge is required. Institutions might therefore play a greater role in setting and enforcing authorship policies. Disputes could be reduced if authorship criteria were agreed, in writing, among all contributors at the start of a research project. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A modified, iterative novelty sampling method is used to select data points based on classical trajectories computed on temporary NN surfaces. After seven iterations, the sampling process is found to converge after selecting 9604 configurations. Incorporation of symmetry increases this to 19 208 BeH3 configurations. The analytic PES for the system is obtained from the ensemble average of a five-member (6-60-1) NN committee. The mean absolute error (MAE) for the committee is 0.0046 eV (0.44 kJ mol(-1)). The total energy range of the BeH3 database is 147.0 kJ mol(-1). Therefore, this MAE represents a percent energy error of 0.30%. Since it is the gradient of the PES that constitutes the most important quantity in molecular dynamics simulations, the paper also reports mean absolute error for the gradient. This result is 0.026 eV angstrom(-1) (2.51 kJ mol(-1) angstrom(-1)). Since the gradient magnitudes span a range of 15.32 eV angstrom(-1) over the configuration space tested, this mean absolute gradient error represents a percent error of 0.17%.

Objectives To evaluate the effect of aldosterone antagonists (both selective (eplerenone) and non-selective (spironolactone)) alone or in combination with ACEi or ARB in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including major cardiovascular events, hospitalisation and all-cause mortality; kidney function (proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, and need for renal replacement therapy; and adverse events (including gynaecomastia and hyperkalaemia). Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 30 January 2013 using search terms relevant to this review. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists alone or in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) with other anti-hypertensive strategies or placebo. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. We tested for heterogeneity in estimated treatment effects using the Cochran Q test and I-2 statistic. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used. Main results We identified 27 studies (1549 participants) that were eligible for inclusion. These studies provided no data relating to aldosterone antagonists in addition to ACEi or ARB (or both) on patient-level outcomes including major cardiovascular events and mortality and progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis or transplantation. Compared with ACEi or ARB (or both), non-selective aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone) combined with ACEi or ARB (or both) significantly reduced 24-hour protein excretion (11 studies, 596 participants): SMD -0.61, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.13). There was a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) at the end of treatment with additional non-selective aldosterone antagonist therapy (systolic BP (10 studies, 556 participants): MD -3.44 mm Hg, 95% CI -5.05 to -1.83) (diastolic BP (9 studies, 520 participants): MD -1.73 mm Hg, 95% CI -2.83 to -0.62). However, we found that aldosterone antagonist treatment had imprecise effects at the end of treatment on GFR (9 studies, 528 participants; MD -2.55 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -5.67 to 0.51), doubled the risk of hyperkalaemia (11 studies, 632 patients): RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.20; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH): 7.2, 95% CI 3.4 to) and increased the risk of gynaecomastia compared to ACEi or ARB (or both) (4 studies, 281 patients): RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23; NNTH: 14.1, 95% CI 8.7 to 37.3). Most studies enrolled few patients (range 12 to 268) and were powered to observe differences in surrogate end points rather than patient-focused outcomes. Nine studies had a cross-over design and the majority of studies did not adequately report study methods to assess methods and study quality. Authors' conclusions Aldosterone antagonists reduced proteinuria and blood pressure in adults who had mild to moderate CKD and were treated with ACEi or ARB (or both), but increase hyperkalaemia and gynaecomastia. Whether adding aldosterone antagonists to ACEi or ARB (or both) reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events or ESKD in this population is unknown.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bolignano, Davide/0000-0003-3032-245X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1469-493X","1361-6137",NA,NA,NA,NA,2014,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CD007004","10.1002/14651858.CD007004.pub3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000335885200004",24782282,233,"233 no 1"

But some patients do not attain complete resolution of proteinuria and might have higher aldosterone levels within few months of treatment. The addition of aldosterone antagonists may be beneficial to these patients for reduction of progression of renal damage. Objectives We evaluated the benefits and harms of adding aldosterone antagonists in patients with CKD currently treated with ACEi and/or ARB. Search strategy We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and hand-searched reference lists of textbooks, articles and scientific proceedings for relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing aldosterone antagonists in addition to ACEi and/or ARB versus ACEi and/or ARB alone were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model and heterogeneity was tested formally using the Cochran Q and I(2) statistic. Results were expressed as mean difference ( MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Ten studies (845 patients) were included. Compared to ACEi and/or ARB plus placebo, non-selective aldosterone antagonists along with ACEi and/or ARB significantly reduced 24 hour proteinuria (7 studies, 372 patients; MD -0.80 g, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.38). There was a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the end of treatment with the addition of non-selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi and/or ARB. This did not translate into an improvement in glomerular filtration rate (5 studies, 306 patients; MD -0.70 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -4.73 to 3.34). There was a significant increase in the risk of hyperkalaemia with the addition of non-selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi and/or ARB (8 studies, 436 patients; RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.26 to 7.41). In two studies, the addition of selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi resulted in an additional reduction in 24 hour proteinuria but without any impact on BP and renal function. Data on cardiovascular outcomes, long-term renal outcomes and mortality were not available.

Materials and Methods: The short hairpin RNA transcription vector was transfected into the RT2 rat glioma cell line and the characteristics of the cells were investigated. The effect of nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) anti-neoplastic agent on cells was also measured. Results: Inhibition of ROCK isoforms did not alter cell growth. Cell cycle analysis revealed that ROCK1 down-regulation reduced the G(0) phase population and ROCK2 down-regulation reduced the G(2)/M phase population. When ROCK1-down-regulated cells were exposed to ACNU, they demonstrated susceptibility to the agent. Conclusion: The roles of ROCK1 and ROCK2 may be different in glioma cells.

Apart from its actions via ROCK, RhoA has recently been found to activate a scaffold protein MEKK1 known to promote ERK activation. We examined whether RhoA can substantially affect ERK activity via this MEKK1-mediated crosstalk between RhoA and EGFR-ERK pathway. By extending the published EGFR-ERK simulation models represented by ordinary differential equations, we developed a simulation model that includes this crosstalk, which was validated with a number of experimental findings and published simulation results. Results: Our simulation suggested that, via this crosstalk, RhoA elevation substantially prolonged duration of ERK activation at both normal and reduced Ras levels. Our model suggests ERK may be activated in the absence of Ras. When Ras is overexpressed, RhoA elevation significantly prolongs duration of ERK activation but reduces the amount of active ERK partly due to competitive binding between ERK and RhoA to MEKK1. Our results indicated possible roles of RhoA in affecting ERK activities via MEKK1-mediated crosstalk, which seems to be supported by indications from several experimental studies that may also implicate the collective regulation of cell fate and progression of cancer and other diseases.",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Baowen/G-3003-2011; Ung, Choong Yong/D-4525-2012; Low, Boon /H-8049-2012","Li, Baowen/0000-0002-8728-520X; Low, Boon /0000-0003-0756-096X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1367-4803",NA,NA,NA,NA,"01-Feb",2009,"25","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"358","364",NA,"10.1093/bioinformatics/btn635",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000262959500011",19074159,234,"234 no 2"

In this study, we investigated the aggregation properties of a monoclonal antibody during agitation stress. Agitation exclusively led to insoluble aggregates, or particle formation. Removal or modification of the air-liquid interface with a surfactant (e.g., polysorbate) abrogated particle formation. The supernatant postagitation was analyzed using SE-HPLC, FTIR, and AUC analyses and revealed no changes in conformation and aggregation profile when compared to the nonagitated antibody sample. The antibody particles were comprised of a combination of nonnative intermolecular disulfide-linked covalent as well as noncovalent interactions. Analysis of the antibody's unpaired cysteines revealed that the normative intermolecular disulfide bonds were formed through buried cysteines, which suggested at least partial unfolding of the antibody domains. FTIR analysis indicated that the particulated antibody maintained significant native-like secondary structure suggesting that particle formation led to minimal structure changes, but capable of exposing free cysteines to solvent to form the normative intermolecular disulfide bonds. The results presented in this study indicate the importance of the interactions between the antibody and the air-liquid interface during agitation in the formation of particles and suggests that reduced disulfide bonds may play a significant role in the particulation reaction. This phenomenon can be applicable to other proteins with similar free cysteine and structural characteristics.

However, identification of most precise and consistent QTL across the environments and genetics backgrounds is essential for their successful use in Marker-assisted Selection. In this study, an attempt was made to locate consistent QTL regions associated with yield increase under drought by applying a genome-wide QTL meta-analysis approach. Results: The integration of 15 maps resulted in a consensus map with 531 markers and a total map length of 1821 cM. Fifty-three yield QTL reported in 15 studies were projected on a consensus map and meta-analysis was performed. Fourteen meta-QTL were obtained on seven chromosomes. MQTL(1.2), MQTL(1.3), MQTL(1.4), and MQTL(12.1) were around 700 kb and corresponded to a reasonably small genetic distance of 1.8 to 5 cM and they are suitable for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS). The meta-QTL for grain yield under drought coincided with at least one of the meta-QTL identified for root and leaf morphology traits under drought in earlier reports. Validation of major-effect QTL on a panel of random drought-tolerant lines revealed the presence of at least one major QTL in each line. DTY(12.1) was present in 85% of the lines, followed by DTY(4.1) in 79% and DTY(1.1) in 64% of the lines. Comparative genomics of meta-QTL with other cereals revealed that the homologous regions of MQTL(1.4) and MQTL(3.2) had QTL for grain yield under drought in maize, wheat, and barley respectively. The genes in the meta-QTL regions were analyzed by a comparative genomics approach and candidate genes were deduced for grain yield under drought. Three groups of genes such as stress-inducible genes, growth and development-related genes, and sugar transport-related genes were found in clusters in most of the meta-QTL. Conclusions: Meta-QTL with small genetic and physical intervals could be useful in Marker-assisted selection individually and in combinations.

In a pilot study, we found that the novel gasotransmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), had a vasodilatory and proerectile action on the cavernosum. In the present work, we explored the ability of the cavernosum to synthesize H2S and its mechanism on the cavernosal pathways. Aim. To evaluate the physiopharmacological responses and mechanism in the erectile function of H2S in rabbit cavernosum. Methods. Rabbit corpus cavernosum (CC) smooth muscle tissue (N = 5) was homogenized and incubated with L-cysteine (10 mM) and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (2 mM) to detect H2S formation. In isometric tension studies on rabbits (N = 12), the effect of sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS; stable H,S donor, 100 mu M-3.2 mM) was evaluated on the relaxant and contractile pathways in the cavernous smooth muscle using standard pharmacological tools. Main Outcome Measures. In vitro evidences for cavernosal H2S formation and proerectile pharmacological effects. Results. H2S was readily synthesized in the rabbit CC (2.1 +/- 0.4 nmol/mg protein). In organ bath studies, NaHS consistently relaxed the rabbit CC in a concentration-dependent manner. MDL 12,330A and 1-H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3 -a]-quinoxalin-1-one inhibited the NaHS relaxation by 22.5% and 14.7%, respectively. All three enzyme inhibitors (aminooxyacetic acid [AOAA], P-cyanoalanine [P-CA], and DL-propargylglycine [PAG] [1 mM]) markedly increased the noradrenergic contractile neurotransmission of CC strips to field stimulation with minimal reversal by cysteine (1 mM) indicating the possible inherent inhibition of the relaxant H2S formation. AOAA, P-CA, or PAG had no significant effect on nitrergic relaxation of noradrenaline-precontracted CC strips. Conclusion. These pioneering studies provide evidence for the endogenous formation of H2S and its proerectile relaxant effect on the cavernosum, with the possibility of involvement of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate pathway.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1743-6095",NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2007,"4","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1304","1311",NA,"10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00561.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000249251200015",17655658,243,"243 no 2"

In this study we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of nerve regeneration by using an acellular nerve allograft (ANA) injected with allogenic skin-derived precursor differentiated Schwann cells (SKP-SCs) and heregulin-1 beta. Skin-derived precursor cells (SKPs) were generated from dermis of newborn (postnatal day 2) Wistar rats. In a rat model, nerve regeneration was determined across a 15 mm lesion in the sciatic nerve by using an ANA injected with allogenic SKP-SCs and heregulin-1 beta. The electrophysiological analysis, histological examination and electron microscopy were involved in this study. Cultured SKPs expressed nestin and fibronectin, and differentiated into cells with phenotype of SCs that presented characteristic markers of p75NGFR and S100-beta. Implantation of SKP-SCs into the rat models by using ANA and allogenic skin-derived precursor differentiated Schwann cells (SKP-SCs) increases sciatic nerve functional index (SFI), peak amplitudes, nerve conduction velocities, number of myelinated fibers within the graft, while reduces incubation period, sciatic nerve injury-induced weight and contractions loss. Using ANA injected with SKP-SCs combined with heregulin-1 beta greatly promote peripheral nerve repair in a rat model. Our results suggest that SKP-SCs transplantation with heregulin-1 beta represents a powerful therapeutic approach, and facilitates the efficacy of acellular nerve allograft in peripheral nerve injury, though the detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated.

The demand for safe and effective vaccine products is increasing due to the potential use of biothreat agents, and the emergence and reemergence of various pathogens. The implementation and use of vaccines in immunologically naive recipients in outbreak settings places extraordinary demands on the timing of the onset of immunity in a relatively broad population base, including those populations which may not always be ideal for delivery of vaccines (e. g., neonates, pregnant women, and the elderly). Each of these populations has its own unique demands for the induction of protective immunity and safety. For example, changes in immune function are present as the immune system matures or declines in neonates and the elderly, respectively. In addition, alterations in hormonal status and to functional changes necessary to accommodate the developing fetus are factors in the scheme used to promote immediate development of effector cells plus the capacity to induce long-term memory pools in pregnant women. The development of immunologic memory is the standard for disease prophylaxis and the basis for most protective vaccines with the induction of both T-cell responses (CD4 and/or CD8 responses) and the production of neutralizing antibody. The kinetics of induction of primary adaptive immune responses in immunologically naive subjects is dictated by many factors including cell cycle transit time to increase the frequency of antigen-reactive cells and the relative rate at which effector cells acquire partial or full functional activities. Memory responses in B-and T-cell compartments are influenced by the phenotype, frequency, and persistence of cells over time (Robinson and Amara, 2005). Generation of effector and memory T cells, which contribute to both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, requires antigen processing and presentation by cells of the innate immune system on class I or class II major histocompatibility molecules (MHC). In addition, the production of essential cytokines, crucial for early steps in the differentiation of lymphocytes is necessary for the generation of effector and memory T cells.

In S phase, when DNA replication initiates, pre-RCs are disassembled, and new pre-RC assembly is restricted until the following G1 period. As a result, DNA replication is limited to a single round per cell cycle. One inhibitor of pre-RC assembly, geminin, was discovered in Xenopus, and it binds and inactivates Cdt1 in S phase. However, removal of geminin from Xenopus egg extracts is insufficient to cause rereplication, suggesting that other safeguards against rereplication exist. Here, we show that Cdt1 is completely degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis during the course of the first round of DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts. Degradation depends on Cdk2/Cyclin E, Cdc45, RPA, and polymerase a, demonstrating a requirement for replication initiation. Cdt1 is ubiquitinated on chromatin, and this process also requires replication initiation. Once replication has initiated, Cdk2/Cyclin E is dispensable for Cdt1 degradation. When fresh Cdt1 is supplied after the first round of DNA replication, significant rereplication results, and rereplication is enhanced in the absence of geminin.

On one hand, HAART has altered the course of HIV disease, with longer survival of HIV-infected patients, and cardiovascular complications of HIV infection such as myocarditis have been reduced. On the other hand, HAART is associated with an increase in the prevalence of both peripheral and coronary arterial disease. As longevity increases in HIV-infected individuals, long-term effects, such as cardiovascular disease, are emerging as leading health issues in this population. In the present review article, we discuss HIV-associated cardiovascular disease, focusing on epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, management and therapy. Cardiovascular involvement in treatment-naive patients is still important in situations such as non-adherence to treatment, late initiation of treatment, and/or limited access to HAART in developing countries. We therefore describe the cardiovascular consequences in treatment-naive patients and the potential effect of antiretroviral treatment on their regression, as well as the metabolic and cardiovascular implications of HAART regimens in HIV-infected individuals.

We tested 24 subjects who had undergone unilateral lower limb amputations for vascular diseases as they walked at a self-selected comfortable speed on the floor and on a treadmill. The tests were conducted at the end of rehabilitative treatment to fit prosthesis. Eight subjects underwent transtibial and 16 transfemoral amputation. The measurements were taken with a portable gas analyzer. The self-selected comfortable speed on the treadmill was significantly lower than that on the floor, where the patients adopted the aid they normally used for walking; oxygen consumption was the same in the two tests.

Undoubtedly, 'druggable' targets and events will be discovered that will improve our understanding and, hopefully, treatment of cancer. Highlighting an alternative to this 'genome-centric' approach, this review will further explore an underappreciated mechanism of gene expression regulation, posttranscription mRNA: protein interactions. A key molecule involved in this mode of gene regulation is HuR and we have shown that HuR levels and HuR cellular distribution can predict how pancreatic cancer patients responded to the standard of care chemotherapy (i.e., gemcitabine). HuR regulates posttranscriptional processes through: (1) association with specific mRNA cargos with ARE-rich sequences and (2) stress-induced increased cytoplasmic protein levels. Over multiple laboratories and diverse tumor types, it has been shown that HuR supports tumor survival through its regulation of tumor-promoting transcripts such as VEGF. In this article, we will highlight a recent discovery that this potent post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism has an impact on a common chemotherapeutic, gemcitabine. Specifically, we have identified the mechanism by which HuR can regulate a key gemcitabine metabolic enzyme, deoxycytidine kinase. We will use this example to explore and hypothesize the functional roles that HuR may have on anticancer drug therapies. We will survey novel high throughput global gene expression analysis tools to discover novel HuR targets. Future multidisciplinary approaches focused on HuR biology will provide critical events and 'druggable' targets in cancer that large-scale genomic sequencing efforts will miss.

Although structurally homologous RNA binding proteins HuR and CUGBP2 stabilize COX-2 mRNA, HuR induces whereas CUGBP2 inhibits COX-2 mRNA translation. This study aimed to determine the antagonism between these proteins on COX-2 expression. Methods: COX-2 ARE binding activity was determined by nitrocellulose filter binding and UV cross-linking assays using recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)/HuR and GST/CUGBP2. Protein:protein interactions were determined by GST pull-down, yeast 2-hybrid, and immunocytochemistry assays. Nucleocytoplasmic shutting was determined by heterokaryon analyses.

Objectives: This review presents information on the importance of TG (chemical name, triacylglycerol) in atherogenesis and the relationship of TG to gender, adiposopathy (the pathophysiological transformation of functional adipose tissue into an organ with pathogenic endocrine and immune responses), insulin resistance, sterol-trafficking lipoproteins, and overall vascular health. In addition, this review seeks to explain the complexities of lipid homeostasis and how it is influenced by lipid-modulating medications, reproductive hormones, and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Methods: Using peer-reviewed materials published in English from the extensive libraries of the authors, this narrative review references key epidemiologic, basic science lipid/lipoprotein publications as well as efficacy trials of lipid-modulating, hormonal, and SERM therapies. Results: TG are associated with insulin resistance; the metabolic syndrome; increased atherogenic lipoproteins; and rheologic, inflammatory, and coagulation abnormalities. TG can be influenced by lifestyle and multiple medications used by women, including hormonal therapies. Several studies, but not all, support sex differences in TG. Conclusions: Through effects on sterol-trafficking lipoproteins, TG have a significant influence on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in menopausal women.

Objective: We reviewed currently available information regarding gender differences in the role of the MetS as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods: Using the search terms women, men; sex, gender, sex differences, and gender differences in combination with the metabolic syndrome, we conducted a systematic review of the available literature on sex differences in the MetS. The National Institutes of Health, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases were searched retrospectively from 2007 to 1987. Reference lists of identified articles were also used as a source, and articles were not restricted to the English language. Results: In recent years, the MetS has been more prevalent in men than in women but has risen particularly in young women, where it is mainly driven by obesity. Diagnostic criteria for the MetS vary for the cutoff points and definition of its components in a gender-specific manner. Based on the definition of impaired glucose homeostasis and pathologic abdominal circumference or waist/ hip ratio, more or fewer women are included. Glucose and lipid metabolism are directly modulated by estrogen and testosterone, with a lack of estrogen or a relative increase in testosterone inducing insulin resistance and a proatherogenic lipid profile. Hypertension is a strong risk factor in both sexes, but the prevalence of hypertension increases more rapidly in aging women than in men. Menopause and polycystic ovary syndrome contribute to the development of MetS by the direct effects of sex hormones. Some components of the MetS (eg, diabetes and hypertension) carry a greater risk for CVD in women. Conclusions: Future gender-related clinical and research activities should focus on the identification of sex- and gender-specific criteria for risk management in patients with the MetS. We propose small, focused, mechanistic studies on sex-specific surrogate end points and sex-specific studies in animal models for diabetes and aging.

The correlated mutations (CM) method serves as the most promising approach and it has been used to predict amino acids pairs that are distant in the primary sequence but form contacts in the native 3D structure of homologous proteins. Results: Here we report a new implementation of the CM method with an added set of selection rules (filters). The parameters of the algorithm were optimized against fifteen high resolution crystal structures with optimization criterion that maximized the confidentiality of the predictions. The optimization resulted in a true positive ratio (TPR) of 0.08 for the CM without filters and a TPR of 0.14 for the CM with filters. The protocol was further benchmarked against 65 high resolution structures that were not included in the optimization test. The benchmarking resulted in a TPR of 0.07 for the CM without filters and to a TPR of 0.09 for the CM with filters. Conclusion: Thus, the inclusion of selection rules resulted to an overall improvement of 30%. In addition, the pair-wise comparison of TPR for each protein without and with filters resulted in an average improvement of 1.7. The methodology was implemented into a web server http://www.ces.clemson.edu/compbio/recon that is freely available to the public.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 26 healthy individuals and 31 patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) were cultured with combinations of CRP, purified or recombinant beta(2)-GPI, and LPS and monocyte TF procoagulant activity, TF antigen, and TF mRNA were measured. Results were examined against plasma CRP levels. Results. Monocytes from patients with IRD expressed significantly more TF when stimulated with CRP compared to normal monocytes (p = 0.002). An incremental positive correlation was observed between plasma CRP levels and TF induced by CRP or beta(2)-GPI. Significantly more TF was induced with CRP combined with beta(2)-GPI, compared to beta(2)-GPI alone, either with costimulation or CRP priming. Conversely, when combined with LPS, beta(2)-GPI suppressed TF induction in a dose-dependent manner on normal PBMC but not on PBMC from patients with IRD.

We have recently identified autoreactive CD4(+) T cells to beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) that promote production of pathogenic antiphosphotipid antibodies. beta(2)GPI-specific CD4(+) T cells preferentially recognize the antigenic peptide containing the major phospholipid (PL)-binding site in the context of DR53. T-cell helper activity that stimulates B cells to produce IgG anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies is mediated through IL-6 and CD40-CD154 interaction. beta(2)GPI-specific T cells respond to reduced beta(2)GPI and recombinant beta(2)GPI fragments produced in a bacterial expression system but not to native beta(2)GPI, indicating that the epitopes recognized by beta(2)GPI-specific T cells are 'cryptic' determinants, which are generated at a subthreshold level by the processing of native beta(2)GPI under normal circumstances. Although beta(2)GPI-specific T cells are detected in both APS patients and healthy individuals, these autoreactive T cells are activated in vivo in APS patients but not in healthy individuals. These findings indicate activation of beta(2)GPI-specific T cells and subsequent production of pathogenic anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies can be induced by the exposure of such T cells to cryptic peptides of beta(2)GPI efficiently presented by functional antigen-presenting cells (APC). Delineating the mechanisms that induce the efficient processing and presentation of cryptic determinants of beta(2)GPI as a consequence of antigen processing would clarify the etiology that initiates the autoantibody response in APS.

The mechanism of action of teriparatide is unique in that it possesses anabolic properties and therefore builds bone. Since the approval of teriparatide in the United States in 2002, a great deal of interest regarding its use in osteoporosis has developed.. Objectives: This article reviews the information available on the new recombinant human parathyroid hormone teriparatide (hPTH [1-34]), including its clinical pharmacology, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic properties, clinical efficacy, safety profile, potential drug interactions, contraindications and warnings, dosage and administration, and pharmacoeconomics. Methods: The articles included in this review were identified through searches of PubMed and MEDLINE (1966-December 2003) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-December 2003). Search terms included teriparatide, Forteo, recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1-34), and osteoporosis. The references of the identified articles were reviewed for additional publications. Specific product information was also obtained from the manufacturer of teriparatide. Results: Teriparatide has been studied in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, drug-induced osteoporosis (specifically, corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis), and men with osteoporosis. The data available from various clinical trials have shown an increase in both bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) with the use of teriparatide compared with placebo. One study found that women treated with the 20-mug dose and the 40-mug dose were 35% and 40%, respectively, less likely to have one or more new nonvertebral fractures compared with placebo (P = 0.02). Another study compared the use of daily teriparaticle 40-mug injections versus oral daily alendronate. Results showed that the incidence of nonvertebral fractures was significantly lower in the teriparaticle group than the alendronate group (P < 0.05). A study using 20- and 40-mug daily injections of teriparaticle was performed in men with osteoporosis. There was a statistically significant increase in lumbar spine BMD of 5.9% in the 20-mug group and 9.0% in the 40-mug group (both, P < 0.001). In the femoral neck, a 1.5% increase in BMD occurred in the 20-mug group (P = 0.021) and a 0.9% increase in the 40-mug group (P < 0.001). A limited number of studies are available assessing the combination of antiresorptive medications and teriparaticle; however, the available data suggest that the effects of teriparaticle do not require prior stimulation of bone resorption. Conclusions: Teriparatide has been shown clinically to improve BMD and BMC in postmenopausal women and in men. Because of its anabolic capabilities, teriparaticle can be used as an alternative to the traditional therapies that are currently available for the treatment of osteoporosis, with scheduled monitoring for adverse effects such as hypercalcemia and urinary calcium excretion. In I study, mild hypercalcemia was seen most often 4 to 6 hours after SC injection of teriparatide before returning to normal. Urinary calcium was observed to increase by 30 mg/d (0.75 mmol/d) with teriparatide.

Receptor binding often involves protein-protein interactions, but carbohydrates may serve as receptor determinants as well. In fact, many different viruses use members of the sialic acid family either as their main receptor or as an initial attachment factor. Sialic acids (Sias) are 9-carbon negatively-charged monosaccharides commonly occurring as terminal residues of glycoconjugates. They come in a large variety and are differentially expressed in cells and tissues. By targeting specific Sia subtypes, viruses achieve host cell selectivity, but only to a certain extent. The Sia of choice might still be abundantly present on non-cell associated molecules, on non-target cells (including cells already infected) and even on virus particles themselves. This poses a hazard, as high-affinity virion binding to any of such ""false'' receptors would result in loss of infectivity. Some enveloped RNA viruses deal with this problem by encoding virion-associated receptor-destroying enzymes (RDEs). These enzymes make the attachment to Sia reversible, thus providing the virus with an escape ticket. RDEs occur in two types: neuraminidases and sialate-O-acetylesterases. The latter, originally discovered in influenza C virus, are also found in certain nidoviruses, namely in group 2 coronaviruses and in toroviruses, as well as in infectious salmon anemia virus, an orthomyxovirus of teleosts.

Irradiation with red+far-red light induced a moderate increase in cAMP levels, while white light induced a pronounced increase in cAMP levels. When incubated under increasing white light irradiance, cAMP levels closely followed the increase in photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate, suggesting a direct relationship between photosynthesis and cAMP accumulation. cAMP levels were not dependent on cellular ATP concentration, as inhibitors of ATP synthesis did not significantly affect cAMP levels in light.

Plagiarism is much less frequent. The review of published accounts also shows that the publication of scientific papers containing recognizable fraudulent material is very low, probably less than 0.02% and extremely difficult to detect. Because most reported cases of fraud have involved research done at prestigious organizations with distinguished co-authors, and that is published in journals with exacting review processes, it becomes evident that some unscrupulous scientists are adept at fabricating and falsifying data. However, ""significant"" scientific fraud is detected when scientists repeatedly report results that cannot be independently verified, when colleagues report suspicious behaviour, or scientific audits are performed. This review documents and compares many of the better-known cases of scientific fraud. Fraudulent behaviour has served as the impetus for the scientific community to develop publication procedures and guidelines that help to guard against not only fraudulent behaviour but also against other types of unethical or undesirable behaviours.

In recent years, some scientists have differentiated the cells into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) successfully, providing a new cell source for neural disease therapy. However, the differentiation methods still need to be improved for the clinical studies in the future. In this study, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was tested to ameliorate UC-MSCs neural differentiation. Main methods: IGF-1 overexpressing UC-MSCs (UC-MSCs-IGF-1) were established through retroviral infection, and further differentiated into NPCs through neural induction. The proliferation and differentiation ability of UC-MSCs derived NPCs were evaluated respectively and the associated signaling mechanisms were further analyzed with RNA microarray, qPCR and western-blot. Key findings: Compared with NPCs from normal UC-MSCs, the NPCs derived from UC-MSCs-IGF-1 hold better proliferation ability and more Pax6-positive cells and Nestin-positive cells. Moreover, the UC-MSCs-IGF-1 derived NPCs could differentiate into astrocyte with higher efficiency during the process of terminal differentiation in vitro. RNA microarray analysis indicated that some key genes associated with neural differentiation and NPCs proliferation were upregulated, which were also confirmed with qPCR and western-blot. Finally, NPCs from UC-MSCs-IGF-1 transfected with IGF-1-siRNA showed a decrease of proliferation ability and astrocyte differentiation. Significance: This study indicated that IGF-1 could improve neural differentiation of human UC-MSCs and provided a novel strategy to enhance astrocyte differentiation of NPCs from UC-MSCs.

Scytonemin accumulation decreases soil albedo significantly. Such localized warming has apparent and immediate consequences for the soil microbiome, inducing the replacement of thermosensitive bacterial species with more thermotolerant forms.

Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) seems to be key in MDD. The aims of the present study were therefore two-fold, to investigate in a three-arm interventional study the differential effects of ECT, ECT plus AET, and AET alone in patients suffering from TR-MDD on 1. depressive symptoms and 2. plasma BDNF (pBDNF). Methods: 60 patients with MDD (mean age: 31 years; 31.6% female patients) were randomly assigned either to the ECT, ECT 4-AET, or AET condition. The AET condition consisted of treadmill exercise for 45 min, three times a week. Both depression severity and pBDNF levels were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks later. All patients were further treated with an SSRI standard medication. Results: pBDNF levels increased over time in all three study conditions, though, highest increase was observed in the ECT + EAT condition, and lowest increase was observed in the AET condition. Depressive symptoms decreased in all three conditions over time, though, strongest decrease was observed in the ECT + AET condition. The combination of ECT + AET led to significantly greater remission rates than in either the ECT or AET alone conditions. BDNF levels were not associated with symptoms of depression. Conclusions: The pattern of results suggests that ECT, AET and particularly their combination are promising directions for the treatment of patients suffering from MDD, and that it remains unclear to what extent pBDNF is key and a reliable biomarker for MDD.

However, their limitations are obvious, including ethical concerns and/or a short life span. The use of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) could avoid these problems. Nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) is an important component of natural bone and bone tissue engineering scaffolds. However, its regulation on osteogenic differentiation with hiPSCs from human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the osteogenic differentiation of hiPSCs from patient-derived hGFs regulated by nHA/chitosan/gelatin (HCG) scaffolds with different nHA ratios, such as HCG-111 (1 wt/vol% nHA) and HCG-311 (3 wt/vol% nHA). First, hGFs were reprogrammed into hiPSCs, which have enhanced osteogenic differentiation capability. Second, HCG-111 and HCG-311 scaffolds were successfully synthesized. Finally, hiPSC/HCG complexes were cultured in vitro or subcutaneously transplanted into immunocompromised mice in vivo. The osteogenic differentiation effects of two types of HCG scaffolds on hiPSCs were assessed for up to 12 weeks. The results showed that HCG-311 increased osteogenic-related gene expression of hiPSCs in vitro proved by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and hiPSC/HCG-311 complexes formed much bone-like tissue in vivo, indicated by cone-beam computed tomography imaging, H&E staining, Masson staining, and RUNX-2, OCN immunohistochemistry staining. In conclusion, our study has shown that osteogenic differentiation of hiPSCs from hGFs was improved by HCG-311. The mechanism might be that the nHA addition stimulates osteogenic marker expression of hiPSCs from hGFs.

OBJECTIVE To clarify whether the number of removed lymph nodes influences mortality following surgery for esophageal cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Conducted from January 1, 2000, to January 31, 2014, this was a cohort study of patients who underwent esophagectomy for cancer in 2000-2012 at a high-volume hospital for esophageal cancer surgery, with follow-up until 2014. EXPOSURES The main exposure was the number of resected lymph nodes. Secondary exposures were the number of metastatic lymph nodes and positive to negative lymph node ratio. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The independent role of the extent of lymphadenectomy in relation to all-cause and disease-specific 5-year mortality was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression models, providing hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. The HRs were adjusted for age, pathological T category, tumor differentiation, margin status, calendar period of surgery, and response to preoperative chemotherapy. RESULTS Among 606 included patients, 506 (83.5%) had adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, 323 (53%) died within 5 years of surgery, and 235 (39%) died of tumor recurrence. The extent of lymphadenectomy was not statistically significantly associated with all-cause or disease-specific mortality, independent of the categorization of lymphadenectomy or stratification for T category, calendar period, or chemotherapy. Patients in the fourth quartile of the number of removed nodes (21-52 nodes) did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in all-cause 5-year mortality compared with those in the lowest quartile (0-10 nodes) (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.63-1.17), particularly not in the most recent calendar period (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.57-1.66 for years 2007-2012). A greater number of metastatic nodes and a higher positive to negative node ratio was associated with increased mortality rates, and these associations showed dose-response associations.

These genes displayed a high performance in classifying COPD patients and normal samples, revealed COPD-related pathways, and have been confirmed to be associated with COPD by Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)-values, literature, an independent data set, and pathways. The MMMG method that analyzed multiomics data at the functional level could effectively identify potential COPD genes. These potential COPD genes would provide in-depth insights into understanding the complexity of COPD genome landscapes, improve the early diagnostics, and guide new efforts to develop therapeutics in the future.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1742-206X","1742-2051",NA,NA,NA,NA,2016,"12","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"191","204",NA,"10.1039/c5mb00577a",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000367200100019",26575263,284,"284 no 1"

Methods Mechanical colorectal distension was performed to induce VH in neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats. Eight-week-old VH rats were treated with moxibustion at acupuncture point BL25 or an ipsilateral non-acupuncture point. Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scoring and pain threshold pressure assessment were performed before and after moxibustion treatment for 7 consecutive days. The expression of TRPV1 and HSP70 in bone marrow cells was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR. Results The expression of TRPV1 and HSP70 in bone marrow cells was increased in rats with VH. Moxibustion at BL25 significantly decreased AWR scores and increased pain threshold pressure in rats with VH. Furthermore, moxibustion at BL25 significantly inhibited the VH-induced increase in the expression of TRPV1 and HSP70 in bone marrow cells.

The BKPyV oncogene, the large T antigen (LTag), has frequently been detected in areas of proliferative inflammatory atrophy, which is considered a precursor lesion leading to prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and overt PCa. In a recently updated systematic review, the presence of BKPyV was significantly higher in PCa tissues than in healthy control tissues, providing an indication for a link between BKPyV infection and cancer risk. In addition, recent original investigations highlighted an association between expression of the virus and the clinical course of PCa. For example, by studying immune responses elicited against BKPyV LTag, a significant association between LTag positive cancer lesions and a peculiar regulatory profiling has been observed in PCa patients with evidence of disease recurrence after surgical radical prostatectomy. Lastly, a study carried out in a larger cohort of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy revealed the IgG response against LTag as an independent predictor of disease recurrence. Although a full picture of the mechanisms potentially responsible for the involvement of BKPyV in PCa is not available yet, continuing work on this topic should help to refine the potential role of BKPyV in PCa patients, perhaps revealing unsuspected associations with the clinical course of this disease.

E7 abrogates the G(1) cell cycle checkpoint and induces genomic instability, but the mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptional profile of keratinocytes expressing HPV 16 (HPV-16) E7. At the transcriptome level, 236 genes were differentially expressed between E7 and vector control cells. A subset of the differentially expressed genes, most of them novel to E7-expressing cells, was further confirmed by real-time PCR. Of interest, the activities of multiple transcription factors were altered in E7-expressing cells. Through bioinformatics analysis, pathways altered in E7-expressing cells were investigated. The upregulated genes were enriched in cell cycle and DNA replication, as well as in the DNA metabolic process, transcription, DNA damage, DNA repair, and nucleotide metabolism. Specifically, we focused our studies on the gene encoding WDHD1 (WD repeat and high mobility group [HMG]-box DNA-binding protein), one of the genes that was upregulated in E7-expressing cells. WDHD1 is a component of the replisome that regulates DNA replication. Recent studies suggest that WDHD1 may also function as a DNA replication initiation factor as well as a G(1) checkpoint regulator. We found that in E7-expressing cells, the steady-state level of WDHD1 protein was increased along with the half-life. Moreover, downregulation of WDHD1 reduced E7-induced G(1) checkpoint abrogation and rereplication, demonstrating a novel function for WDHD1.

Cells can die passively, as a consequence of severe damage to their structural integrity, or actively, owing to a more confined biological disruption such as DNA damage. Passive cell death is uncontrolled and often harmful to the organism. In contrast, active cell death is tightly regulated and serves to support the organism's life. Apoptosis-the primary form of regulated cell death-is relatively well defined. Necroptosis-an alternative, distinct kind of regulated cell death discovered more recently-is less well understood.

Ephedra water decoction (EWD) and cough tablets containing ephedra and liquorice (maxing cough tablets, MXCT) have been widely used in the treatment of asthma. In the clinic, EWD and MXCT may be prescribed with theophylline, one of the most popular antiasthmatic drugs. CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 are mainly involved in the oxidative metabolism of theophylline in human liver. Drug interactions involving the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms generally are of two types: enzyme induction or enzyme inhibition. Enzyme inhibition reduces metabolism, whereas induction can increase it.2. To evaluate the pretreatment effect of EWD and MXCT on CYP1A2 and CYP2E1, CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 activity, the protein expression and mRNA expression levels were determined. After pretreatment with EWD or MXCT, the enzyme activity, mRNA expression and protein expression of CYP1A2 were increased significantly (p<0.05), but enzyme activity of CYP2E1 did not change compared with the control.3.

Methods: Rat RGCs were isolated and purified using three methods, including two-step immunopanning (TIP) separation, two-step immunopanning-magnetic (TIPM) separation, and flow cytometric (FC) separation. Immunocytochemical staining, quantitative real-time PCR, flow cytometry, electrophysiology, and Cell Counting Kit -8 (CCK-8) analyses were performed to compare the purity, yield, and viability of the RGCs. Results: The RGC yields from the TIP, TIPM, and FC methods were 24.60 +/- 15.98 X 10(4), 5.28 +/- 4.42 X 10(4), and 5.4 +/- 2.7 103 per retina, respectively.

In this article we compare three evolutionary accounts of how people reason about identity stability, and the effect that the cultural evolution of ethnic group boundaries may have on these beliefs. We test our hypotheses among Himba pastoralists in Namibia, whose recent fission from the neighboring Herero makes them ideal for studying the effect of cultural distance on folk beliefs about identity stability. In a vignette experiment, we asked participants whether an individual born in one group who moved to another group would retain their original group membership and cultural characteristics or acquire those of the new group. Across vignette conditions we examine the importance of the direction of migration, parental social influence, and age at migration on perceptions of identity stability. We also compare participant responses to two out-groups, the Herero, and the more distantly related Damara. We find that participants seldom thought of identity as stable or fixed at birth. Furthermore, we show that cultural distance and endogamous preferences are independent of beliefs of identity stability.

Expression of the embryonic marker genes WOX2, ATML1, PIN4, WUS and STM, related to axis organization, cell identity and meristem functions, is also altered in dek1 embryos.

These results are consistent with a requirement for DEK1 to direct layer-specific cellular activities and set downstream developmental cues. Our data suggest that DEK1 may anchor cell wall positions and control cell division and differentiation, thereby balancing the plant's requirement to maintain totipotent stem cell reservoirs while simultaneously directing growth and organ formation.

Such vacancy ordering and electron localization give rise to a profound influence on material properties. First, the dispersive gap states are expected to act as stepping stones to facilitate the electron excitation from valence band to conduction band, contributing to extended optical absorption in the longer wavelengths and thus enhancing photovoltaic and photocatalytic functionalities. Also, the linear ordering of oxygen vacancies leads to the electron localization on Ce ions and oxygen vacancy sites, inducing the polarization of electrons on vacancy sites which effectively enhances stability of ferromagnetism.

A number of additional studies originating from our laboratory and others clearly demonstrate that A20 is part of the liver response to injury and resection. Upregulation of A20 in hepatocytes serves a broad hepatoprotective goal through combined anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant and pro-regenerative functions. The molecular basis for A20's hepatoprotective functions were partially resolved and include blockade of NF-kappa B activation in support of its anti-inflammatory function, inhibition of pro-caspase 8 cleavage in support of its anti-apoptotic function, increasing Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor a (PPAR alpha) expression in support of its anti-oxidant function, and decreasing Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 while boosting IL-6/STAT3 proliferative signals as part of its pro-regenerative function. In experimental animal models, overexpression of A20 in the liver protects from radical acute fulminant toxic hepatitis, lethal hepatectomy, and severe liver ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), and allows successful engraftment of marginal liver grafts. Conversely, partial loss of A20, as in A20 heterozygote mice, significantly impairs liver regeneration and damage, which confers high lethality to an otherwise safe procedure i.e., 2/3 partial hepatectomy. This is the ultimate proof of the physiologic role of A20 in liver regeneration and repair. In recent work, A20's functions in the liver have expanded to encompass regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism, unlocking a whole new set of metabolic diseases that could be affected by A20.

Mutations within the NBN gene are responsible for the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). The 90% of NBS patients are homozygous for the 657del5 mutation, which determines the synthesis of two truncated proteins of 26 kDa (p26) and 70 kDa (p70). Here, HEK293 cells have been exploited to transiently express either the full-length NBN protein or the p26 or p70 fragments, followed by affinity chromatography enrichment of the eluates. The application of an unsupervised proteomics approach, based upon SDS-PAGE separation and shotgun digestion of protein bands followed by MS/MS protein identification, indicates the occurrence of previously unreported protein interacting partners of the full-length NBN protein and the p26 fragment containing the FHA/BRCT1 domains, especially after cell irradiation. In particular, results obtained shed light on new possible roles of NBN and of the p26 fragment in ROS scavenging, in the DNA damage response, and in protein folding and degradation. In particular, here we show that p26 interacts with PARP1 after irradiation, and this interaction exerts an inhibitory effect on PARP1 activity as measured by NAD+ levels. Furthermore, the p26-PARP1 interaction seems to be responsible for the persistence of ROS, and in turn of DSBs, at 24 h from IR.

Using high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR), 1043 miRNAs were investigated in maternal plasma via comparison of seven DS pregnancies with age and fetal sex matched controls. Results. Six hundred and ninety-five miRNAs were identified. Thirty-six significantly differentially expressed mature miRNAs were identified as potential biomarkers. Hierarchical cluster analysis of these miRNAs resulted in the clear discrimination of DS from euploid pregnancies. Gene targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched in signaling pathways such asmucin type-O-glycans, ECM-receptor interactions, TGF-beta, and endocytosis, which have been previously associated with DS.

However, it also greatly hinders drug permeability into the brain and limits the management of brain diseases. The development of new drugs that show improved transport across the BBB represents a promising strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) intervention. Whereas, previous study of receptor-mediated endogenous BBB transport systems has focused on a strategy of using transferrin to facilitate brain drug delivery system, a system that still suffers from limitations including synthesis procedure, stability and immunological response. In the present study, we synthetised sialic acid (SA)-modified selenium (Se) nanoparticles conjugated with an alternative peptide-B6 peptide (B6-SA-SeNP5, a synthetic selenoprotein analogue), which shows high permeability across the BBB and has the potential to serve as a novel nanomedicine for disease modification in AD. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy, flow cytometry analysis and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy ICP-AES revealed high cellular uptake of B6-SA-SeNP5 by cerebral endothelial cells (bEnd3). The transport efficiency of B6-SA-SeNP5 was evaluated in a Transwell experiment based on in vitro BBB model. It provided direct evidence for B6-SA-SeNP5 crossing the BBB and being absorbed by PC12 cells. Moreover, inhibitory effects of B6-SA-SeNPs on amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) fibrillation could be demonstrated in PC12 cells and bEnd3 cells. B6-SA-SeNP5 could not only effectively inhibit A beta aggregation but could disaggregate preformed A beta fibrils into non-toxic amorphous oligomers. These results suggested that B6-SA-SeNP5 may provide a promising platform, particularly for the application of nanoparticles in the treatment of brain diseases. Statement of Significance Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the world's most common form of dementia characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Over the past decades, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits access of therapeutic or diagnostic agents into the brain, which greatly hinders the development of new drugs for treating AD. In this work, we evaluated the efficiency of B6-SA-SeNP5 across BBB and investigated the interactions between B6-SA-SeNP5 and amyloid-beta peptide (A beta). We confirm that B6-SA-SeNP5 could provide a promising platform because of its high brain delivery efficiency, anti-amyloid properties and anti-oxidant properties, which may serve as a novel nanomedicine for the application in the treatment of brain diseases.

MCF-7 cells were treated with ginsenoside Rg1 and incubated with or without PMA. The protein and mRNA expression of MMP-9 and MMP-2 was analyzed using Transwell and wound-healing assays and western blotting. The results showed that suppression was associated with the reduced secretion of MMP-9, a key metastatic enzyme. MMP-9 levels were regulated transcriptionally and correlated with the suppression of NF-kappa B phosphorylation and DNA binding activity. Conversely, ginsenoside Rg1 did not affect MMP-2 mRNA and TIMP-1 mRNA levels, or the activation of AP-1, suggesting a specificity of pathway inhibition. Inhibition of NF-kappa B activation by p65 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) was shown to suppress PMA-induced cell invasion and migration. The siRNA studies also showed that PMA-induced MMP-9 expression is NF-kappa B-dependent.

In this review, we focus on the use of computational modeling, bioinformatics and high-throughput experimental methods for discovery of drug combinations. We highlight cutting-edge systems approaches, including large-scale modeling of cell signaling networks, network motif analysis, statistical association-based models, identifying correlations in gene signatures, functional genomics, and high-throughput combination screens. We also present a list of publicly available data and resources to aid in discovery of drug combinations.

This article addresses the problem of finding optimal inspection policies for the multi-station manufacturing system (MMS) subjected to quality shifts to minimise total quality-related cost. Each station of the MMS may stay at either in-control condition or out-of-control condition, which may lead to different nonconforming product rates. Markov chain method is used to calculate the steady-state probability distribution (SSPD). Based on the SSPD, the cost structure of this MMS is analysed. The economical optimisation model of attribute control charts (ACCs) is then established, in which the decision variables are the control chart parameters: sampling interval, sample size and control limit. The ACCs optimisation model is resolved by the proposed integrated algorithm combining heuristic rule and tabu search. This approach is verified through an application case taken from a mobile phone shell production company.

It is often used in hatcheries, particularly in the production of bivalve spat. It is widely produced in batch culture systems ranging from carboys to plastic bags to high volume tanks. Continuous culture of C. calcitrans has generally not been successful due to frequent crashes of the culture. We report the continuous culture of C. calcitrans in a hanging plastic bag system that is suitable for use in commercial hatcheries. Runs of continuous production lasted up to 125 d, with an average bag life of 24.4 d. Crashes occurred at irregular intervals in individual bags and caused the cell concentration to drop by up to three orders of magnitude. Cultures recovered over a few days following a crash. The temporary reduction of production due to crashes in individual bags was compensated by a 30% higher production than required. At dilution rates of 1.0-1.3 volume exchanges d(-1) the system produced 7-13 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) d(-1). The cell diameter mode as determined by a Coulter Counter was 2.8-3.0 mu m. The cells had the typical flat rectangular box shape with well-developed setae. The culturable bacterial population of the algae culture was 10(5)-10(7) colony forming units mL(-1). Genetic integrity of C. calcitrans and monospecific status of the continuous culture were maintained over 7 sequential bag-to-bag transfers during a 125-day run. The fatty acid profiles of continuous and batch cultures of C. calcitrans were similar. Growth and survival of Greenshell (TM) mussel (Perna canaliculus) larvae were identical when fed with C. calcitrans batch culture or continuous culture delivered directly from the harvest line. When continuous culture was first collected over 24 h, diluted and then delivered to the rearing tanks over 24 h, larval growth was markedly slower (24d to reach settlement competency compared to 21 d for the other two treatments); however the subsequent settlement success of competent larvae was not statistically different between the three diets ('Carboy', 'Continuous/Harvest line', 'Continuous/Feed-out bin'; 33.9-35.5% settled). Concomitant to the differences in larval performance we observed a difference in larval fatty acid profile: lower-performing larvae had a markedly lower proportion of mono-unsaturated fatty acids and a markedly higher proportion of poly-unsaturated fatty acids. Lower performance and different fatty acid profiles of larvae fed the 'Continuous/Feed-out bin' diet appeared to be caused by unidentified changes that occurred during storage of the C. calcitrans culture.

Here, we apply methods typically utilized in macroecology to explain variation in the putative cultural traits of chimpanzees.

We used a canonical correspondence analysis to examine the relative importance of environmental characteristics and geography, which may be a proxy for inter-community gene flow and/or social transmission, for explaining geographic variation in chimpanzee behavior. We found that geography, and longitude in particular, was the best predictor of behavioral variation. Chimpanzee communities in close longitudinal proximity to each other exhibit similar behavioral repertoires, independent of local ecological factors. No ecological variables were significantly related to behavioral variation. These results support the idea that inter-community dispersal patterns have played a major role in structuring behavioral variation.

Transmission electron microscopic measurements showed that carbon nanospheres were homogeneously dispersed in the matrix of exfoliated graphene sheets, and Pt3Ni nanoparticles were distributed on the graphene surfaces without apparent agglomeration, where the average core size was estimated to be 12.6 +/- 2.4 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies demonstrated that electron transfer likely occurred from the Pt3Ni alloy nanoparticles to the graphene sheets. Electrochemical measurements showed that the mass activity of the Pt3Ni C/rGO catalysts in methanol oxidation was 1.7-times higher than that of Pt3Ni nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide alone (Pt3Ni/rGO), and 1.3-times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). Additionally, CO tolerance and durability were also remarkably enhanced. These superior electrocatalytic activities were attributed to the following major factors: (i) the insertion of carbon nanospheres into the graphene matrix prevented restacking/refolding of the graphene sheets, leading to an increasing number of accessible active sites as well as transport channels for mass and charges; and (ii) the synergetic effect between Pt3Ni nanoparticles and rGO weakened the bonding interactions with reactant species, as manifested by the enhanced kinetics of methanol oxidation and CO oxidative desorption.

Data on the relation between 25(OH)D concentrations and HCV treatment response in HIV-infected patients are limited. Objective: The objective was to determine whether baseline 25(OH)D concentrations predict virologic response in BIV/HCV co-infected patients and to examine variables associated with 25(OH)D concentrations >= 30 ng/mL. Design: Data and samples from 144 HCV genotype 1, treatment-naive patients from a completed HCV treatment trial were examined in this retrospective study. Early virologic response (EVR) was defined as >= 2 log(10) reduction in HCV RNA and/or HCV RNA <600 IU/mL at week 12 of peg-interferon/ribavirin treatment. Baseline 25(OH)D was measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Compared with the non-EVR control group (n = 68), the EVR group (n = 76) was younger, had fewer cirrhotic subjects, had a higher proportion with the IL28B CC genotype, had a higher albumin concentration, and had a lower HCV viral load at baseline (P <= 0.05). The difference in baseline 25(OH)D concentrations between EVR and non-EVR patients was not statistically significant (median: 25 ng/mL compared with 20 ng/mL; P = 0.23). Similar results were found for sustained virologic response (SVR). In multivariable analysis, white and Hispanic race-ethnicity (OR: 6.26; 95% CI: 2.47, 15.88; P = 0.0001) and ritonavir use (OR: 2.68; 95% CI: 1.08, 6.65; P = 0.033) were associated with higher 25 (OH)D concentrations (>= 30 ng/mL). Conclusion: Baseline 25(OH)D concentrations did not predict EVR or SVR.

Analysis of the retraction notices for 423 articles indexed in PubMed revealed that the most common causes of error-related retraction are laboratory errors, analytical errors, and irreproducible results. The most common laboratory errors are contamination and problems relating to molecular biology procedures (e.g., sequencing, cloning). Retractions due to contamination were more common in the past, whereas analytical errors are now increasing in frequency. A number of publications that have not been retracted despite being shown to contain significant errors suggest that barriers to retraction may impede correction of the literature. In particular, few cases of retraction due to cell line contamination were found despite recognition that this problem has affected numerous publications. An understanding of the errors leading to retraction can guide practices to improve laboratory research and the integrity of the scientific literature.

Mice were fed either an HF/HS diet with 0.25% of polyphenol from GT, OT, or BT or a low-fat/high-sucrose [LF/HS (10.6% energy from fat, 25% energy from sucrose)] diet for 20 wk.

Our observations showed that ASC significantly suppressed human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) growth both in vitro and in vivo. This may be resulted from the G2/M cell cycle arrest effects of ASC. Moreover, ASC inhibited HUVECs invasion and tube formation processes, which were associated with endothelial cells remodelling. A mechanism study indicated that ASC down-regulated the expression of Src tyrosine kinase, further leading to the blockage of Akt-dependent matrix metalloproteinases (mainly for MMP-9) signalling pathway, which was functionally associated with angiogenic blood vessels.

Methods: A meta-analysis was performed of postoperative blood loss in randomized clinical trials of hydroxyethyl starch versus albumin for fluid management in adult cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Impacts of hydroxyethyl starch molecular weight and molar substitution were assessed. Randomized trials directly comparing different hydroxyethyl starch solutions were also included. Results: Eighteen trials with 970 total patients were included. Compared with albumin, hydroxyethyl starch increased postoperative blood loss by 33.3% of a pooled SD (95% confidence interval, 18.2%-48.3%; P < .001). Risk of reoperation for bleeding was more than doubled by hydroxyethyl starch (relative risk, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.40; P - .020). Hydroxyethyl starch increased transfusion of red blood cells by 28.4% of a pooled SD (95% confidence interval, 12.2%-44.6%; P < .001), of fresh-frozen plasma by 30.6%(95% confidence interval, 8.0%-53.1%; P = .008), and of platelets by 29.8% (95% confidence interval, 3.4%-56.2%; P = .027).

Recent studies have also shown that a genome-wide pattern of local adaptation can be detected by identifying correlations between patterns of allele frequencies and environmental variables. Despite these observations, the degree to which natural selection is primarily driven by adaptation to local environments, and the role of pathogens or other ecological factors as selective agents, is still under debate. To address this issue, we correlated the spatial allele frequency distribution of a large sample of SNPs from 55 distinct human populations to a set of environmental factors that describe local geographical features such as climate, diet regimes, and pathogen loads. In concordance with previous studies, we detected a significant enrichment of genic SNPs, and particularly non-synonymous SNPs associated with local adaptation. Furthermore, we show that the diversity of the local pathogenic environment is the predominant driver of local adaptation, and that climate, at least as measured here, only plays a relatively minor role. While background demography by far makes the strongest contribution in explaining the genetic variance among populations, we detected about 100 genes which show an unexpectedly strong correlation between allele frequencies and pathogenic environment, after correcting for demography. Conversely, for diet regimes and climatic conditions, no genes show a similar correlation between the environmental factor and allele frequencies. This result is validated using low-coverage sequencing data for multiple populations.

Of significant interest is curcumin's role to treat neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) and malignancy. These diseases all share an inflammatory basis, involving increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and oxidative damage to lipids, nucleic acids and proteins. The therapeutic benefits of curcumin for these neurodegenerative diseases appear multifactorial via regulation of transcription factors, cytokines and enzymes associated with (Nuclear factor kappa beta) NF kappa B activity. This review describes the historical use of curcumin in medicine, its chemistry, stability and biological activities, including curcumin's anti-cancer, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.

Here, we studied the protective effect of intravenous infusion of physostigmine in a rat model of severe intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and shock. Materials and methods: Mesenteric I/R was induced in male Wistar rats by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (90 min) and subsequent reperfusion (120 min). Physostigmine (30 or 70 mu g/kg) was administered as bolus injection before induction of I/R. One additional group received, subsequent to the bolus of 30-mu g/kg physostigmine, a continuous infusion of 60-mu g/kg physostigmine till the end of the experiment. Results: Physostigmine at a dose of 70 mu g/kg administered before I/R significantly decreased the macroscopically and microscopically visible intestinal damage. In addition to and presumably as a result of this local protective effect, physostigmine prevented shock induced by reperfusion of the ischemically injured intestine. Lower doses (30 mu g/kg) or continuous application of physostigmine were less advantageous. Conclusions: Physostigmine is clearly protective in intestinal I/R injury and shock. However, for this purpose, physostigmine has to be applied at a dose (70 mu g/kg), that is, approximately double the amount of the presently used clinical dose. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

PET/CT with F-18-FDG allows the assessment of both lung aeration and neutrophil inflammation as well as an estimation of the regional fraction of blood (FB) if compartmental modeling is used to quantify F-18-FDG pulmonary uptake. The aim of this study was to validate the use of FB to assess PBF, with PET and compartmental modeling of O-15-H2O kinetics as a reference method, in both control animals and animals with ALI. For the purpose of studying a wide range of PBF values, supine and prone positions and various positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEPs) and tidal volumes (V(T)s) were selected. Methods: Pigs were randomized into 3 groups in which ALI was induced by HCl inhalation: pigs studied in the supine position with a low PEEP (5 +/- 3 [mean +/- SD] cm of H2O; n = 9) or a high PEEP (12 +/- 1 cm of H2O; n 5 8) and pigs studied in the prone position with a low PEEP (6 +/- 3 cm of H2O; n = 9). Also included were a control group that did not have ALI (n = 6) and 2 additional groups (n = 6 each) that had a high V-T to maintain a transpulmonary pressure of greater than or equal to 35 cm of H2O and that either received HCl inhalation or did not receive HCl inhalation. PBF and FB were measured with PET and compartmental modeling of O-15-H2O and F-18-FDG kinetics in 10 lung regions along the anterior-to-posterior lung dimension, and both were expressed in each region as a fraction of their values in the whole lung. Results: PBF and FB were strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.9), with a slope of the regression line close to unity and a negligible intercept. The mean difference between PBF and FB was 0, and the 95% limits of agreement were -0.035 to 0.035. This good agreement between methods was obtained in both normal and injured lungs and under a wide range of V-T, PEEP, and regional PBF values (7-71 mL/kg, 0-15 cm of H2O, and 24-603 mL.min(-1).100 mL of lung(-1), respectively).

In most cases, fungal prions are carried without apparent detriment to the host cell, representing a novel form of epigenetic inheritance. This raises the question of whether or not yeast prions are beneficial survival factors or actually gives rise to a ""disease state"" that is selected against in nature. To date, most studies on the impact of fungal prions have focused on laboratory-cultivated ""domesticated"" strains of S. cerevisiae. At least eight prions have now been described in this species, each with the potential to impact on a wide range of cellular processes. The discovery of prions in nondomesticated strains of S. cerevisiae and P. anserina has confirmed that prions are not simply an artifact of ""domestication"" of this species. In this review, I describe what we currently know about the phenotypic impact of fungal prions. I then describe how the interplay between host genotype and the prion-mediated changes can generate a wide array of phenotypic diversity. How such prion-generated diversity may be of benefit to the host in survival in a fluctuating, often hazardous environment is then outlined.

Nearly 80% of the enrolees were classified as multimorbid and low income earners presented the highest prevalence of multimorbidity. After controlling for age and gender, increases in the number of Rx-MG assignments were associated with higher total healthcare costs. After controlling for the effects of Rx-MG assignment and demographic characteristics, physicians, paramedical personnel, and public servant were found to generate higher total costs than typical employees/self-employed enrolees, while low-income earners generated lower costs. High income levels were also found to be associated with lower total costs. It was also revealed that occupation and multimorbidity have a moderating effect on healthcare cost. Conclusions: Increases in the prevalence of multimorbidity are associated with higher health care costs. This study determined that instances of multimorbidity varied according to socioeconomic class; likewise there were inequities in healthcare utilization among individuals of various occupations and income levels, even when demographic characteristics and multimorbidity were controlled for. This highlights the importance of socioeconomic status with regard to healthcare utilization. These results indicate that socioeconomic factors should not be discounted when discussing the utilization of healthcare by patients with multimorbidity.",NA,NA,NA,"KUO, NIEN-CHEN/B-1302-2008;","KUO, NIEN-CHEN/0000-0003-4980-853X; Lai, Mei-shu/0000-0001-6130-3468",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1475-9276",NA,NA,NA,NA,"20-Aug",2013,"12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"69","10.1186/1475-9276-12-69",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000323526500001",23962201,391,"391 no 1"

However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In stroke, ischemia-induced zinc release and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) accumulation concurrently occur in the ischemic tissue. The present study tests the hypothesis that the presence of high intracellular zinc concentration is a major cause of modifications to PARP-1 and HIF-1 during hypoxia, which significantly contributes to cell death during ischemia. Methods Primary cortical astrocytes and C8-D1A cells were exposed to different concentrations of zinc chloride. Cell death rate and protein expression of HIF-1 and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 were examined after 3-h hypoxic treatment. Results Although 3-h hypoxia or 100M of zinc alone did not induce noticeable cytotoxicity, their combination led to a dramatic increase in astrocytic cell death in a zinc-concentration-dependent manner. Exposure of astrocytes to hypoxia for 3h remarkably increased the levels of intracellular zinc and HIF-1 protein, which was further augmented by added exogenous zinc. Notably, HIF-1 knockdown blocked zinc-induced astrocyte death. Moreover, knockdown of PARP-1, another important protein in the response of hypoxia, attenuated the overexpression of HIF-1 and reduced the cell death rate.

This review covers natural agents, including vitamins, oligoelements, polyphenols, isoflavones, indoles, isothiocyanates, phospholipids, saponins, anthraquinones and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and synthetic agents, including thiols, nuclear receptor agonists, histone deacetylase inhibitors, antiinflammatory drugs, and selective estrogen receptor modulators.

Most studies used cancer cells in vitro with the goal of modifying their phenotype by changing miRNA expression profiles. In vivo studies evaluated regulation of miRNAs by chemopreventive agents in organs of mice and rats, either untreated or exposed to carcinogens, with the objective of evaluating their safety and efficacy. The tissue specificity of miRNAs could be exploited for the chemoprevention of site-specific cancers, and the study of polymorphic miRNAs is expected to predict the individual response to chemopreventive agents as a tool for developing new prevention strategies.

Microglial cells are emerging in this context as master regulators with a bi-functional role in the progression of the pathological response. They foster a pro-inflammatory setting through the production of cytotoxic cytokines and chemokines (M1 phenotype), after an aborted effort to sustain an anti-inflammatory environment for motor neurons through the release of beneficial cytokines and growth factors (M2 phenotype). In this review, we gather information meant to propose that histamine and ATP, which are released from mast cells, microglia and damaged neurons at sites of injury where they function as transmitters, have to be considered as new players in the ALS neuroinflammatory arena. After all, abnormal histamine and ATP signalling in the brain are already documented in neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer and Parkinson's disease and, at present, histamine-as well as ATP-related compounds are in clinical trial for these same pathologies. Concerning ALS, while emerging data are now available about purinergic mechanisms, the involvement of histamine is basically unexplored. The circumstantial evidence that we present here thus constitutes a solid background for formulating novel hypotheses, stimulating a scientific debate and, most of all, inspiring future research.

Recently, a second SDF-1 receptor, CXCR7, was found to enhance tumor growth in solid tumors. Albeit signaling cascades via SDF-1/CXCR4 have been intensively studied, the significance of the SDF-1/CXCR7-induced intracellular communication triggering malignancy is still only marginally understood. Experimental Design: In tumor tissue of 52 patients with colorectal cancer, we observed that expression of CXCR7 and CXCR4 increased with tumor stage and tumor size. Asking whether activation of CXCR4 or CXCR7 might result in a similar expression pattern, we performed microarray expression analyses using lentivirally CXCR4- and/or CXCR7-overexpressing SW480 colon cancer cell lines with and without stimulation by SDF-1 alpha. Results: Gene regulation via SDF-1 alpha/CXCR4 and SDF-1 alpha/CXCR7 was completely different and partly antidromic. Differentially regulated genes were assigned by gene ontology to migration, proliferation, and lipid metabolic processes. Expressions of AKR1C3, AXL, C5, IGFBP7, IL24, RRAS, and TNNC1 were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Using the in silico gene set enrichment analysis, we showed that expressions of miR-217 and miR-218 were increased in CXCR4 and reduced in CXCR7 cells after stimulation with SDF-1 alpha. Functionally, exposure to SDF-1 alpha increased invasiveness of CXCR4 and CXCR7 cells, AXL knockdown hampered invasion. Compared with controls, CXCR4 cells showed increased sensitivity against 5-FU, whereas CXCR7 cells were more chemoresistant. Conclusions: These opposing results for CXCR4- or CXCR7-overexpressing colon carcinoma cells demand an unexpected attention in the clinical application of chemokine receptor antagonists such as plerixafor.

Peripheral circulating EPC number and function are robust biomarkers of vascular risk for a multitude of diseases, particularly CVD (cardiovascular disease). Importantly, using EPCs as a biomarker is independent of both traditional and non-traditional risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and C-reactive protein), with infused ex vivo-expanded EPCs showing potential for improved endothelial function and either reducing the risk of events or enhancing recovery from ischaemia. However, as the number of existing cardiovascular risk factors is variable between patients, simple EPC counts do not adequately describe vascular disease risk in all clinical conditions and, as such, the risk of CVD remains. It is likely that this limitation is attributable to variation in the definition of EPCs, as well as a difference in the interaction between EPCs and other cells involved in vascular control such as pericytes, smooth muscle cells and macrophages. For EPCs to be used regularly in clinical practice, agreement on definitions of EPC subtypes is needed, and recognition that function of EPCs (rather than number) may be a better marker of vascular risk in certain CVD risk states. The present review focuses on the identification of measures to improve individual risk stratification and, further, to potentially individualize patient care to address specific EPC functional abnormalities.

Methods: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Scopus, Psyclnfo and CAMBASE were screened through April 2013. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Tai Chi to control conditions were included. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias using the risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. Outcome measures included pain, physical functional, joint stiffness, quality of life, and safety. For each outcome, standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: 5 RCTs with a total of 252 patients were included. Four studies had a low risk of bias. Analysis showed moderate overall evidence for short-term effectiveness for pain, physical function, and stiffness. Strong evidence was found for short-term improvement of the physical component of quality of life. No long-term effects were observed. Tai Chi therapy was not associated with serious adverse events. Conclusion: This systematic review found moderate evidence for short-term improvement of pain, physical function and stiffness in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee practicing Tai Chi.

Although it has been suggested in both in vitro and small in vivo human studies that chromium has potentially beneficial effects in type 2 diabetes (T2D), chromium supplementation in diabetes has not been investigated at the population level. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the use and potential benefits of chromium supplementation in T2D by examining NHANES data. Methods: An individual was defined as having diabetes if he or she had a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value of >= 6.5%, or reported having been diagnosed with diabetes. Data on all consumed dietary supplements from the NHANES database were analyzed, with the OR of having diabetes as the main outcome of interest based on chromium supplement use. Results: The NHANES for the years 1999-2010 included information on 62,160 individuals. After filtering the database for the required covariates (gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, body mass index, diabetes diagnosis, supplement usage, and laboratory HbA1c values), and when restricted to adults, the study cohort included 28,539 people. A total of 58.3% of people reported consuming a dietary supplement in the previous 30 d, 28.8% reported consuming a dietary supplement that contained chromium, and 0.7% consumed supplements that had ""chromium'' in the title. Compared with nonusers, the odds of having T2D (HbA1c >= 6.5%) were lower in persons who consumed chromium-containing supplements within the previous 30 d than in those who did not (OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.86; P = 0.001). Supplement use alone (without chromium) did not influence the odds of having T2D (OR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.03; P = 0.11). Conclusions: Over one-half the adult US population consumes nutritional supplements, and over one-quarter consumes supplemental chromium. The odds of having T2D were lower in those who, in the previous 30 d, had consumed supplements containing chromium.

There is little scope for curiosity that played an important role in early Science. Results carrying negative implications are not easy to publish, and hypotheses have a tendency to take on the mantra of religious beliefs. Academic Science is facing on many fronts pressures that hardly existed in the past. Financial rewards apart from salary can be very high, in the form of fees for consultants, expert legal witnesses, patent development and even the establishment of private companies. Commercial funding forms a significant percentage of the Total Research Budgets in Science and Medicine, but this often leads to loss of control over research protocols and freedom to communicate the results. Media attention confers fame and prestige that is assiduously sought out by some individuals scientists, often supported by University resources, and Press Conferences prior to or synchronous with actual publication. Scientists have long been employed full-time by Government Departments, but research contracts are being increasingly offered by the latter to academic staff on a part-time basis. These pressures and opportunities, together with the priority given to research by most University Tenure and Promotion Committees, are tending to diminish the appetite of scientists for other important responsibilities such as teaching and administration. In a few decades, University scientists have moved from the ""Ivory Tower"" to the High Street, and many are serving more than one master. The above scenario may bring increased remuneration and the pursuit of research that would be too expensive without these external sources, but adverse consequences have also occurred. They may lead to the complicity of scientists, through no fault of their own, in the introduction of drugs and supplements that: a) fail to deliver the benefits claimed; b) increase the risk of some unrelated illness; c) possess dangerous side effects not known or reported at the time of introduction. Examples include hormone replacement therapy and antioxidant vitamins (A and E) to protect against Coronary Heart Disease; dietary fibre to prevent colon cancer; and arguably calcium supplements to treat osteoporosis. On occasions, academic scientists have served as fronts for the publication by the manufacturers of falsified reports minimizing the risk of serious drug side-effects to ensure Regulatory Approval, as occurred with Vioxx in the treatment of arthritis, and Seroquel for schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Individual fraud or misconduct is more frequent than suspected, because most incidents are without major impact and are suppressed by Universities and Funding Agencies. Major scandals are rare, but may have serious repercussions for the general public and bring science into disrepute. Recent examples include: the Cold Fusion controversy (Low Energy Nuclear Reaction); the linkage by Andrew Wakefield of autism with Rubella vaccination; the infamous creation of stem cells by somatic cell nuclear transfer falsely reported by Hwang Woo-Suk. Fraud by commercial companies is subject to the full force of the law, but Science is treated as a self-regulating profession, and as such the punishments handed out are relatively trivial. In essence, Science prior to 1950, except in North America, proceeded along a highway that segregated the traffic into Commercial, Government and Academic streams, and passed through inspiring landscapes and green pastures. It lter came to a crossroads from which the alternative road led to the Marketplace, and on which segregation into the above three streams was not enforced. It has now become the main thoroughfare for Science world-wide, but there are reasons to believe that this has increased the incidence of dangerous driving and traffic accidents in the form of conflicts of interest, unethical behaviour, misconduct and even fraud. It may be too late to return to the crossroads and continue along the original highway, but there could be considerable merit in restoring the original segregation between the three streams of Science and in developing, as well as enforcing, a stricter code of behaviour, for which some elements are proposed.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1452-8258",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2011,"30","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"79","92",NA,"10.2478/v10011-011-0004-8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000292081000001",NA,419,"419 no 1"

As a prodrug of propofol, fospropofol's pharmacologic activity results from its breakdown by alkaline phosphatase and release of propofol, which is the active molecule. It exhibits a longer time to peak clinical effect and a more prolonged action compared to propofol. Thus patients may exhibit smoother hemodynamic and respiratory depression compared to propofol lipid emulsion bolus. Another advantage over propofol is that it does not induce a burning sensation on IV administration. Side effects include perineal paresthesia and itching, respiratory depression, hypoxemia, hypotension, loss of consciousness, and apnea with higher IV boluses. Therefore, current recommendations call for it to be administered only by clinicians trained in general anesthesia, who are thus skilled in advanced airway management. Fospropofol has a unique dosing regimen, with a standard dose for adults 18-65 years of age, and a modified dose (75% of the standard dose) for patients > 65 years of age and for sicker adult patients whose American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score is >= 3. Also, the minimum and maximun IV bolus doses are body-weight adjusted to 60 and 90 kg respectively. Available evidence demonstrates that fospropofol in MAC sedation is successful in patients undergoing esophagogastroscopy, colonoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy. The use of fospropofol is also now being explored in many other perioperative settings.

Five major moult stages were defined: early- and late post-moult (A and B), inter-moult (C) and early- and late pre-moult (D1 and D2). Total moult cycle duration was around 5 and 6.5 days for 2-g P. vannamei and P. monodon and 11 and 12 days for 15-g P. vannamei and P. monodon, respectively.

However, a lack of pharmacological tools and the absence of convincingly defined endogenous ligands have hampered the understanding of function necessary to exploit it therapeutically. Although several endogenous molecules can activate GPR35 none has yet been confirmed as the key endogenous ligand due to reasons that include lack of biological specificity, non-physiologically relevant potency and species ortholog selectivity. Recent advances have identified several highly potent synthetic agonists and antagonists, as well as agonists with equivalent potency at rodent and human orthologs, which will be useful as tool compounds. Homology modeling and mutagenesis studies have provided insight into the mode of ligand binding and possible reasons for the species selectivity of some ligands. Advances have also been made in determining the role of the receptor in disease. In the past, genome-wide association studies have associated GPR35 with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease.

In this paper, we used microRNA-21 (mir-21) as the target to examine the desirable properties of this assay. When the target, as a trigger, was hybridized with the HP and caused a conformation change, an efficient isothermal polymerization reaction was activated to achieve the first step of the signal amplification. After incubation with the platform of GO/intercalating dye, the formed complex of DNA interacted with the high-affinity dye and then detached from the surface of the GO, a process that was accompanied by distinguishable fluorescence recovery. Further signal enhancement has been accomplished by a mass of intercalating dye inserting into the minor groove of the long duplex replication product. Due to the efficient and multiple amplification steps, this approach exerted a substantial enhancement in sensitivity and could be used for rapid and selective detection of Mir-21 at attomole levels.

This rarity reinforces the concept of folds as reusable units of structure and function shared by diverse proteins. If the folding mechanism of proteins is largely determined by their topology, then the folding pathways of members of existing folds could encompass the full set used by globular protein domains. Results: We have used recent versions of three common protein domain dictionaries (SCOP, CATH and Dali) to generate a consensus domain dictionary (CDD). Surprisingly, 40% of the metafolds in the CDD are not composed of autonomous structural domains, i.e. they are not plausible independent folding units. This finding has serious ramifications for bioinformatics studies mining these domain dictionaries for globular protein properties. However, our main purpose in deriving this CDD was to generate an updated CDD to choose targets for MD simulation as part of our dynameomics effort, which aims to simulate the native and unfolding pathways of representatives of all globular protein consensus folds (metafolds).

In this study, we report the regulation of FGFR-1 expression by related transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (RTEF-1) in vitro (endothelial cells) and in vivo (RTEF-1 transgenic mice). FGFR-1 promoter activity, FGFR-1 mRNA and protein level Were Measured in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) in response to RTEF-1 and in endothelial cells isolated from livers in RTEF-1 transgenic mice. RTEF-1 stimulated FGFR-l promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, RTEF-1 enhanced FGFR-1 mRNA (4-fold) and protein expression (3.5-fold) whereas RTEF-1 siRNA decreased FGFR-1 protein expression (4-fold). FGFR-1 mRNA and protein expression were also increased in endothelial cells isolated from livers of RTEF-1 transgenic mice. Furthermore, RTEF-1 enhanced tubule formation whereas this was decreased by RTEF-1 knockdown. Moreover, increased relaxation of microvessels was found in RTEF-1 transgenic mice compared to wild-type mice. Our results indicate that RTEF-1 acts as a transcriptional stimulator of FGFR-1 in endothelial cells through its activation of the FGFR-1 promoter, RTEF-1 thus plays ail important role in the regulation of FGFR-1 expression. These findings help further understand FGFR activity in angiogenesis and may lead to new therapeutic targets in ischemic vascular disorders. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In the vasculature, S1P and its receptors are involved in vessel morphogenesis and angiogenesis during embryonic development and in the adult organism both under normal and pathological conditions. Via its actions on endothelial and smooth muscle cells, S1P regulates arterial tone, vascular permeability, and tissue perfusion. Elevated local S1P levels during inflammation induce endothelial adhesion molecules, recruit inflammatory cells, and activate dendritic cells. At the same time, S1P activates a negative feedback loop that consecutively seals endothelial cell-cell contacts, decreases vascular leakage, and inhibits cytokine-induced leukocyte adhesion. Thus S1P determines not only the build-up, magnitude, and duration of an inflammatory reaction but also the pace of its resolution. This review focuses on the role S1P plays in endothelial function, its receptors and signalling pathways, and the role its major carrier high-density lipoproteins (HDL) play in its bioavailability and transport.

Isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes were cultured and stimulated with high glucose. RESULTS-In diabetic hearts, NADPH oxidase activation, its subunits' expression, and reactive oxygen species production were inhibited by Rac1 knockout or apocynin treatment Myocardial collagen deposition and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas were significantly increased in diabetic mice, which were accompanied by elevated expression of pro-fibrotic genes and hypertrophic genes. Deficiency of Rac1 or apocynin administration reduced myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy, resulting in improved myocardial function. These effects were associated with a normalization of ER stress markers' expression and inflammatory response in diabetic hearts.

We show that an agonistic monoclonal antibody to TLR4/MD-2 (TLR4-Ab) reverses new-onset diabetes in a high percentage of NOD mice. TLR4-Ab induces antigen-presenting cell (APC) tolerance in vitro and in vivo, resulting in an altered cytokine profile, decreased costimulatory molecule expression, and decreased T-cell proliferation in APC:T-cell assays. TLR4-Ab treatment increases T-regulatory cell (Treg) numbers in both the periphery and the pancreatic islet, predominantly expanding the Helios(+)Nrp-1(+)Foxp(3+) Treg subset. TLR4-Ab treatment in the absence of B cells in NOD.scid mice prevents subsequent T cell-mediated disease, further suggesting a major role for APC tolerization in disease protection.

Endometrial concentrations of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and mRNA and protein expression of collagen IV (CL-IV), fibronectin (FN), and laminin (LN) were evaluated 10, 20, and 30 days after M bovis intrauterine infusion in breed cows 18 days postpartum.

Endometrial TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 concentrations in the treatment group were greater (P < 0.05) than in the positive and negative control groups 20 and 30 days after infusion. Endometrial CL-IV, FN, and LN mRNA and protein expression increased (P < 0.01) 20 days after infusion in all groups.

In conclusion, M bovis triggered endometrial inflammatory response and increased CL-IV, FN, and LN mRNA and protein expression. The abnormal expression of ECM these proteins may promote the pathogenic effects of M bovis that lead to endometrial tissue damage and infertility.

In parallel, IFN-gamma induces the tryptophan-(trp)-degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and triggers the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Translocation of the signal transduction element nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) is induced by ROS and accelerates the pro-inflammatory response by activation of other pro-inflammatory pathways. Therefore, a close relationship between NF-kappa B expression, the production of neopterin and the degradation of trp can be assumed, although this has not been demonstrated so far. In the present in vitro study we compared the influence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on NF-kappa B activation, neopterin formation and the degradation of trp in THP-1Blue cells, which represent the human myelomonocytic cell line THP-1 stably transfected with an NF-kappa B inducible reporter system. In cells stimulated with LPS, a significant induction of NF-kappa B was observed, and this was paralleled by an increase of kynureunine (kyn) and neopterin concentrations and a decline of trp. The increase of the kyn to trp quotient indicates accelerated IDO activity. Higher LPS concentrations and longer incubation of cells were associated with higher activities of all three biochemical pathways and significant correlations existed between NF-kappa B activation, neopterin release and trp degradation (all p < 0.001). We conclude that there is a parallel induction of NF-kappa B, neopterin formation and trp degradation in monocytic THP-1 cells, which is elicited by pro-inflammatory triggers like LPS during innate immune responses.

Certain vasodilators work by opening K+ channels in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and K+ channel activation may also be a route to improving endothelial function. The two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels form a group of 15 known channels with an expanding list of functions in the cardiovascular system. One of these K2P channels, TREK-1, is the focus of this review. TREK-1 channel activity is tightly regulated by intracellular and extracellular pH, membrane stretch, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), temperature, and receptor-coupled second messenger systems. TREK-1 channels are also activated by volatile anesthetics and some neuroprotectant agents, and they are inhibited by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as well as amide local anesthetics. Some of the clinical cardiovascular effects and side effects of these drugs may be through their actions on TREK-1 channels. It has recently been suggested that TREK-1 channels have a role in mechano-electrical coupling in the heart. They also seem important in the vascular responses to PUFAs, and this may underlie some of the beneficial cardiovascular effects of the essential dietary fatty acids.

In pulmonary fibrosis, published reports suggest that collagen production in the injured lung is derived from fibrocytes recruited from the circulation in response to release of pulmonary CXCL12. Conversely, in hepatic fibrosis, resident hepatic stellate cells (HSC), the key cell type in progression of fibrosis, upregulate CXCR4 expression in response to activation. Further, CXCL12 induces HSC proliferation and subsequent production of collagen I. In the current study, we evaluated AMD070, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of CXCL12/CXCR4 in alleviating BLM-induced pulmonary and CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice. Similar to other CXCR4 antagonists, treatment with AMD070 significantly increased leukocyte mobilization. However, in these two models of fibrosis, AMD070 had a negligible impact on extracellular matrix deposition. Interestingly, our results indicated that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling has a role in improving mortality associated with BLM induced pulmonary injury, likely through dampening an early inflammatory response and/or vascular leakage.

Osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary bone cancer in dogs, is commonly treated with adjuvant doxorubicin or carboplatin following amputation of the affected limb. We evaluated the use of gene-expression based models built in an intra-or interspecies manner to predict chemosensitivity and treatment outcome in canine OS. Models were built and evaluated using microarray gene expression and drug sensitivity data from human and canine cancer cell lines, and canine OS tumor datasets. The ""COXEN"" method was utilized to filter gene signatures between human and dog datasets based on strong co-expression patterns. Models were built using linear discriminant analysis via the misclassification penalized posterior algorithm. Results: The best doxorubicin model involved genes identified in human lines that were co-expressed and trained on canine OS tumor data, which accurately predicted clinical outcome in 73 % of dogs (p = 0.0262, binomial). The best carboplatin model utilized canine lines for gene identification and model training, with canine OS tumor data for co-expression. Dogs whose treatment matched our predictions had significantly better clinical outcomes than those that didn't (p = 0.0006, Log Rank), and this predictor significantly associated with longer disease free intervals in a Cox multivariate analysis (hazard ratio = 0.3102, p = 0.0124).

The authors also discuss non-tumor-specific signatures, and provide a comparison of different biopsy methods. The authors also discuss the challenges that must be overcome in this area, looking at the clinical application of gene expression profiling and some of the multigene assays which have gained clinical utility. Expert opinion: Current studies are challenged by a number of issues including: small sample sizes, retrospective analyses, varying chemotherapy regimens and response end points, the need for fresh frozen samples, distinct gene signatures in multiple platforms with minimal overlap and inherent microarray technological complexities.

We sought to develop pharmacogenomic predictors of Tax- and Ixa-response from a large panel of human breast tumor cell lines (BTCL), then to evaluate their performance in clinical samples. Thirty-two BTCL, representative of the molecular diversity of breast cancers (BC), were treated in vitro with Tax (paclitaxel (Pac), docetaxel (Doc)), and ixabepilone (Ixa), then classified as drug-sensitive or resistant according to their 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s).

Gene expression set (GES) predictors of response to taxanes were derived, then tested for validation internally and in publicly available gene expression datasets. In vitro IC50s of Pac and Doc were almost identical, whereas some Tax-resistant BTCL retained sensitivity to Ixa. GES predictors for Tax-sensitivity (333 genes) and Ixa-sensitivity (79 genes) were defined. They displayed a limited number of overlapping genes. Both were validated by leave-n-out cross-validation (n = 4; for overall accuracy (OA), P = 0.028 for Tax, and P = 0.0005 for Ixa). The GES predictor of Tax-sensitivity was tested on publicly available external datasets and significantly predicted Pac-sensitivity in 16 BTCL (P = 0.04 for OA), and pathological complete response to Pac-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in BC patients (P = 0.0045 for OA). Applying Tax and Ixa-GES to a dataset of clinically annotated early BC patients identified subsets of tumors with potentially distinct phenotypes of drug sensitivity: predicted Ixa-sensitive/Tax-resistant BC were significantly (P < 0.05, Fischer's exact test) more frequently ER/PR-positive, Ki67-negative, and luminal subtype than predicted Ixa-resistant/Tax-sensitive BC.

Pretreatment biopsies were available from 211 ER+ HER2- tumors, who had been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (adriamycin/cyclophosphamide). mRNA expression data were available for 132 tumors. We determined progesterone receptor expression (PR), endocrine sensitivity, HER2 expression, histology, proliferation, and molecular subtypes. We correlated these data to chemotherapy response using pCR rates and the previously published neoadjuvant response index (NRI). PR-negative tumors (n = 65, 30.8%) and luminal B type tumors (n = 43, 20.4%) responded significantly better to chemotherapy than other tumors. These associations remained significant in multivariate analysis. However, even in the subgroup of patients with the lowest response rate, comprising tumors that had both a positive-PR expression and the luminal A subtype (n = 58, 44%), the majority of the patients had downstaging because of chemotherapy. For histology (lobular vs. ductal), endocrine sensitivity, and proliferation, no associations with chemotherapy response were observed. Gene expression array analysis resulted in 28 significant genes (FDR < 0.1). PR expression and luminal B status are associated with a better response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Each claims to provide additional prognostic information beyond conventional prognostic markers and to aid in determining who should receive systemic therapy. Evidence for their clinical utility was reviewed to determine whether any of them should be considered as routine clinical test. Methods: Peer reviewed publications, meeting abstracts, and information provided by company web sites have been reviewed to compile information regarding their clinical utility according to the following criteria; (1) Analytical validity and regulatory approval of the reference lab test. (2) Level of evidence for clinical utility. (3) Whether published evidences support prognostic and/or predictive claim. Results: While published evidences for clinical claims for OncotypeDx and Mammaprint used reference lab tests, and the supporting evidences for other tests come from academic assays before being converted to reference lab tests, results from two large randomized clinical trials testing the clinical utility of OncotypeDx and Mammaprint are still several years away and until that time none of the markers would reach level I evidence by Marker Utility Grading System. However Oncotype Dx has reached a level 1B evidence according to Simon modification to Marker Utility Grading System. Therefore OncotypeDx may be considered for routine clinical use as an adjunct to clinical and pathological information and has been incorporated into clinical guidelines in USA. While Mammaprint, MapQuantDx, and PAM50 have been repeatedly demonstrated to provide robust prognostic information, evidence for its worth as a predictive marker for chemotherapy benefit is yet to come from randomize clinical trials and therefore its utility is limited to prognostication. Meta-analysis of publicly available microarray based gene expression studies demonstrated that gene expression assays provide similar information and the most important information they provide is the proliferation activity. In untreated population, the prognostic impact of proliferation genes is limited to ER+HER2- subset since HER2+ or ER-HER2- subsets are associated with high proliferation activity. Therefore the clinical utility of these gene expression based tests is mainly for ER+HER2- subset. Since they are usually treated with adjuvant antiestrogen therapies, for their clinical utility, demonstration of the interaction between the gene expression markers and chemotherapy in anti-estrogen treated cohort in a randomized clinical trial would be required. While OncoytpeDx is the only test supported by studies in a randomized clinical trial for adjuvant chemotherapy, other gene expression based tests are expected to provide similar information. Gene expression profiling assays as more reproducible and precise surrogates for tumor grade (MapQauntDx and Theros Breast Cancer Index) are very promising assays. However, absence of definitive predefined cut-off for defining the subset that benefit from chemotherapy validated in cohorts from randomized trials limit their clinical application.

The objective of this study is the analysis of oncogenic pathways in ovarian cancer and their relation with clinical outcome. Methodology: A meta-analysis of 6 gene expression datasets was done for oncogenic pathway activation scores: AKT, beta-Catenin, BRCA, E2F1, EGFR, ER, HER2, INF alpha, INF gamma, MYC, p53, p63, PI3K, PR, RAS, SRC, STAT3, TNF alpha, and TGF beta and VEGF-A. Advanced serous papillary tumours from uniformly treated patients were selected (N = 464) to find differences independent from stage-, histology- and treatment biases. Survival and correlations with documented prognostic signatures (wound healing response signature WHR/genomic grade index GGI/invasiveness gene signature IGS) were analysed. Results: The GGI, WHR, IGS score were unexpectedly increased in chemosensitive versus chemoresistant patients. PR and RAS activation score were associated with survival outcome (p = 0.002; p = 0.004).

Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is a rare necrotizing vasculitis associated with asthma, blood and tissue eosinophilia and granuloma formation. We wondered whether eosinophil accumulation in CSS results from the defect of intrinsic apoptosis pathway in blood eosinophils, leading to their prolonged survival. Methods. We analysed immunophenotype (flow cytometry), expression of apoptosis-related genes (real-time PCR) and spontaneous apoptosis in blood eosinophils isolated from nine patients in exacerbation (active CSS), seven patients in remission (inactive CSS) and 14 matched healthy subjects. Serum IL-5 levels were also measured. Results. In active CSS, blood eosinophils were characterized by small (< 2-fold) decrease in expression of a few genes, primarily proapoptotic (e.g. BCL2L13, CASP2, CARD4) or involved in regulation of NF-kappa B (IKBKB, REL), but they did not differ in the rate of spontaneous apoptosis, when compared with other groups.

We find that noise is also suppressed under such spin damping, with a characteristic spectral response corresponding to the type of noise; therefore magnetic, photon shot, and spin-projection noise can be measured distinctly. While the suppression of resonant photon shot noise implies the closed-loop production of polarization-squeezed light, the suppression of resonant spin-projection noise does not imply spin squeezing, rather simply the broadening of the noise spectrum with Q. Furthermore, the application of spin damping during phase-sensitive detection suppresses both signal and noise in such a way as to increase the sensitivity bandwidth. We demonstrate a threefold increase in the magnetometer's bandwidth while maintaining 0.3 fT/root Hz sensitivity.

Patients and Methods Women age 40 to 49 with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who had ceased menstruating with adjuvant cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy, had postmenopausal serum estradiol (E2), and had received tamoxifen for >= 1 year were treated with letrozole (2.5 mg) daily for >= 2 years. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and E2 were measured at baseline and over 2 years. Ageneral linear model was used to assess serial FSH by OFR. Logistic regression was used to assess baseline predictors and OFR. Results The study enrolled 177 women (145 women age 45 to 49 years and 32 women age 40 to 44 years). Of 173 evaluable patients, 67 (39%; 95% CI, 31% to 46%) regained ovarian function; 11 of these patients (6%; 95% CI, 3% to 10%) resumed menses, and 56 of these patients (32%; 95% CI, 25% to 39%) developed premenopausal E2 without menses. Among AI-naive patients, serial FSH significantly increased over time (P < .001), did not vary significantly by OFR status (P = .55), but showed mild evidence of a decrease after month 12 for those who resumed menses (P = .0989). Age less than 45 years and inhibin B were significant multivariable baseline predictors of OFR. Conclusion These results emphasize the challenge in determining definitive menopause in women with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. The risk of OFR during treatment with AIs in amenorrheic women in their 40s is high, and AI therapy should be avoided in these patients.

AMPK activation has also been proposed to mimic benefits of caloric restriction and exercise.

Furthermore, we mapped the AMPK/NDPK phosphorylation site (serine 120) as a functionally potent enzymatic ""off switch"" both in vivo and in vitro. Because ATP is usually the most abundant cellular nucleotide, NDPK would normally consume ATP, whereas AMPK would inhibit NDPK to conserve energy. It is intriguing that serine 120 is mutated in advanced neuroblastoma, which suggests a mechanism by which NDPK in neuroblastoma can no longer be inhibited by AMPK-mediated phosphorylation.

Two chemoprevention studies were done to test the resulting hypothesis that COX-2 is a useful target for oral cancer chemoprevention in the rat. In both studies, male F344 rats received drinking water exposure to NQO (20 ppm) for 10 weeks, followed by administration of chemopreventive agents from week 10 until study termination at week 26. In the first study, groups of rats were fed basal diet (control), or basal diet supplemented with the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (500 or 1,500 mg/kg diet), the nonselective COX inhibitor piroxicam (50 or 150 mg/kg diet), or the 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton (2,000 mg/kg diet). In the second study, rats were fed basal diet (control) or basal diet supplemented with nitric oxide-naproxen (180 or 90 mg/kg diet), a nonselective COX inhibitor that shows reduced gastrointestinal toxicity.

Piroxicam decreased cancer-related mortality and cancer invasion score, whereas nitric oxide-naproxen decreased oral cancer incidence and cancer invasion score. By contrast, zileuton showed no chemopreventive activity by any parameter assessed.

Accordingly, biomarkers suitable for the early detection of HNSCC are sorely needed to improve patient outcomes. HNSCC evolve through a multistep process by the accumulation of genetic and phenotypic changes. Searching for specific biomarkers capable of characterizing each degree is therefore really essential. In this review, genomic and gene expression alterations of HNSCC are summarized and associated with HPV status, clinicopathological conditions, and patient history from the perspective of potential biomarker utilization.

The very notion of self has undergone a dramatic change, with the acknowledgment that our 'selves' include a plethora of microbial species that actively participate in our body's homeostasis. The immune system continuously adapts to the microbiota in a cyclic, dynamic cross talk where intestinal epithelial cells play an important role in instructing noninflammatory responses for a steady-state control of bacterial growth, or triggering inflammatory mechanisms that can clear the gut from harmful invaders. The system is complex and robust in the sense that many players with partially overlapping roles act to keep the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Failure of these mechanisms involves genetic and environmental triggers and leads to inflammatory bowel disease. In this review, we seek to collect the state-of-the-art knowledge about how host and microbiota interact to promote gut homeostasis and provide evidences of malfunctioning of the described mechanisms in human inflammatory bowel disease.

Central statistical monitoring (CSM) is a cheaper alternative, where data checks are performed by the coordinating centre, avoiding the need to visit all sites. Several publications have suggested methods for CSM; however, few have described their use in real trials. Methods R-programs were created to check data at either the subject level (7 tests within 3 programs) or site level (9 tests within 8 programs) using previously described methods or new ones we developed. These aimed to find possible data errors such as outliers, incorrect dates, or anomalous data patterns; digit preference, values too close or too far from the means, unusual correlation structures, extreme variances which may indicate fraud or procedural errors and under-reporting of adverse events. The methods were applied to three trials, one of which had closed and has been published, one in follow-up, and a third to which fabricated data were added. We examined how well the methods work, discussing their strengths and limitations. Results The R-programs produced simple tables or easy-to-read figures. Few data errors were found in the first two trials, and those added to the third were easily detected. The programs were able to identify patients with outliers based on single or multiple variables. They also detected (1) fabricated patients, generated to have values too close to the multivariate mean, or with too low variances in repeated measurements, and (2) sites which had unusual correlation structures or too few adverse events. Some methods were unreliable if applied to centres with few patients or if data were fabricated in a way which did not fit the assumptions used to create the programs. Outputs from the R-programs are interpreted using examples. Limitations Detecting data errors is relatively straightforward; however, there are several limitations in the detection of fraud: some programs cannot be applied to small trials or to centres with few patients (<10) and data falsified in a manner which does not fit the program's assumptions may not be detected. In addition, many tests require a visual assessment of the output (showing flagged participants or sites), before data queries are made or on-site visits performed. Conclusions CSM is a worthwhile alternative to on-site data checking and may be used to limit the number of site visits by targeting only sites which are picked up by the programs. We summarise the methods, show how they are implemented and that they can be easy to interpret. The methods can identify incorrect or unusual data for a trial subject, or centres where the data considered together are too different to other centres and therefore should be reviewed, possibly through an on-site visit.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cox, Trevor/0000-0003-3045-5594",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1740-7745","1740-7753",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2013,"10","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"783","806",NA,"10.1177/1740774513494504",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000330526300019",24130202,517,"517 no 1"

With physiological, 2-compartment insulin kinetics models, accurate kinetic parameter values are required for reliable estimates of insulin sensitivity. This study uses data from 6 published microdialysis studies to determine the most appropriate parameter values for the transcapillary diffusion rate (n(I)) and cellular insulin clearance rate (n(C)). The 6 studies (12 data sets) used microdialysis techniques to simultaneously obtain interstitial and plasma insulin concentrations. The reported plasma insulin concentrations were used as input and interstitial insulin concentrations were simulated with the interstitial insulin kinetics sub-model. These simulated results were then compared to the reported interstitial measurements and the most appropriate set of parameter values was determined across the 12 data sets by combining the results. Interstitial insulin kinetic parameters values n(I) = n(C) = 0.0060 min(-1) were shown to be the most appropriate.

Revealing these common mechanisms may provide insight in the organismal level of adaptation and suggest solutions to important problems related to the adaptation. An increased rate of mutations, referred as the mutator phenotype, and beneficial nature of these mutations are common features of the bacterial stationary-state mutagenesis and of the tumorigenic transformations in mammalian cells. We argue that these commonalities of mammalian and bacterial cells result from their stress-induced adaptation that may be described in terms of a common model. Specifically, in both organisms the mutator phenotype is activated in a subpopulation of proliferating stressed cells as a strategy to survival. This strategy is an alternative to other survival strategies, such as senescence and programmed cell death, which are also activated in the stressed cells by different subpopulations. Sustained stress-related proliferative signalling and epigenetic mechanisms play a decisive role in the choice of the mutator phenotype survival strategy in the cells. They reprogram cellular functions by epigenetic silencing of cell-cycle inhibitors, DNA repair, programmed cell death, and by activation of repetitive DNA elements. This reprogramming leads to the mutator phenotype that is implemented by error-prone cell divisions with the involvement of Y family polymerases. Studies supporting the proposed model of stress-induced cellular adaptation are discussed.

Cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a central role in downregulating inflammatory cascade in UC and is likely a candidate for therapeutic intervention. However, its intravenous administration is costly and inconvenient. Therefore, we established a novel IL-10 delivery system by transforming a hIL-10-containing plasmid into B. longum (BL-hIL-10) and investigated its effects on 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis in mice and the possible underlying mechanism. Our results show that (1) hIL-10 was expressed and secreted into the culture supernatant of BL-hIL-10 after L-arabinose induction in vitro as examined by Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and RT-PCR; (2) addition of BL-hIL-10 culture supernatant had no cytotoxic effect and morphological alteration, but significantly inhibited the enhancement of proinflammatory cytokines by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in THP-1 cells; (3) oral administration of BL-hIL-10 alleviated colitis syndrome of the model mice, attenuated colitis-activated NF-kappa B pathway measured by DNA-binding assay and colitis-elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines examined with CCK cytotoxic kits, and upregulated CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg in blood and mesenteric lymph nodes measured by flow cytometry.

A retrospective chart review of the Mayo Clinic database from 1975 to 2005 identified 30 patients < 18 years of age with histologically confirmed pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. RESULTS. There were 12 patients with pheochromocytomas and 18 with paragangliomas. The most common presenting symptoms were hypertension (64%), palpitation (53%), headache (47%), and mass-related effects (30%). Nine patients (30%) had a genetic mutation or documented family history of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Fourteen patients (47%) had malignant disease, whereas 16 (53%) had benign disease. Logistic analysis showed that statistically significant risk factors for malignancy were (1) paraganglioma, (2) apparently sporadic, as opposed to familial, pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, and (3) tumor size of > 6 cm. Surgical resection was performed for 28 patients (93%), with perioperative mortality and major morbidity rates of 0% and 10%, respectively.

Although the effect of sterol accumulation on the predisposition for atherosclerosis is evident, how xenosterol accumulation leads to defects in platelet physiology is unknown. Sitosterolemia induced in Abcg5- and Abcg8-deficient mice fed a high plant sterol diet resulted in accumulation of free sterols in platelet plasma membranes, leading to hyperactivatable platelets characterized by constitutive binding of fibrinogen to its alpha IIb beta 3 integrin receptor, internalization of the alpha IIb beta 3 complex, generation of plateletderived microparticles, and changes in the quantity and subcellular localization of filamin. The latter was associated with macrothrombocytopenia, shedding of GPIb alpha, impaired platelet adhesion to von Willebrand factor, and inability to form stable thrombi. Plasma levels of soluble GPIba were strongly correlated with plasma sitosterol levels in samples from human sitosterolemic patients, implicating a similar mechanism of sterol-induced platelet passivation in the human disease.

METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (1966-2004) that evaluated the efficacy of AED prophylaxis vs no treatment or placebo to prevent seizures In patients with brain tumors who had no history of epilepsy. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Three subanalyses were performed to assess pooled ORs of seizures in patients with primary glial tumors, cerebral metastases, and meningiomas. RESULTS: Of 474 articles found in the initial search, 17 were identified as primary studies. Five trials met Inclusion criteria: patients with a neoplasm (primary glial tumors, cerebral metastases, and meningiomas) but no history of epilepsy who were randomized to either an AED or placebo. The 3 AEDs stud led were phenobarbital, phenytoin, and valproic acid. Of the 5 trials, 4 showed no statistical benefit of seizure prophylaxis with an AED. Meta-analysis confirmed the lack of AED benefit at I week (OR, 0.91; 95% confidence Interval [CI], 0.45-1.83) and at 6 months (OR, 1.01; 95% Cl, 0.51-1.98) of follow-up. The AEDs had no effect on seizure prevention for specific tumor pathology, including primary glial tumors (OR, 3.46; 95% Cl, 0.32-37.47), cerebral metastases (OR, 2.50; 95% Cl, 0.25-24.72), and meningiomas (OR, 0.62; 95% Cl, 0.10-3.85). CONCLUSIONS: No evidence supports AED prophylaxis with phenobarbital, phenytoin, or valproic acid In patients with brain tumors and no history of seizures, regardless of neoplastic type.

In the pyridoacridine series, comprising over a hundred secondary metabolites extracted from ascidians and sponges, the leading products are ascididemin and neoamphimedine, which both exhibit potent cytotoxic activities against tumor cells, in part due to their capacity to intercalate into DNA and to interfere with topoisomerase II.

IRS-1 over-expression in transgenic (Tg) mouse livers caused constitutive activation of Erk mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) resulting in significantly increased levels of DNA synthesis and larger hepatic masses relative to non-transgenic (non-Tg) littermates. However, the livers eventually ceased to grow but remained approximately 25% larger than non-Tg livers. We hypothesized that this growth homeostasis was achieved by parallel activation of pro-apoptosis pathways. Methods: Since Fas-mediated apoptosis is a common mechanism of hepatocyte destruction, we investigated the potential role of Fas receptor as a regulator of hepatic mass in IRS-1 transgenic mice. Results: Significantly increased Fas-receptor levels were detected in the livers of IRS-1 Tg compared to non-Tg mice by Western blot analysis. Functional activation of Fas-receptor in IRS-1 Tg livers was demonstrated by increased hepatocellular apoptosis caused by intravenous injection of anti-Fas (Jo-2). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the increased growth caused by IRS-1 over-expression is balanced by constitutive activation of pro-death mechanisms. Failure of the IRS-1 Tg mice to develop liver cancer may be due to preservation of pro-growth, pro-death homeostasis mechanisms. (C) 2003 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

EPO is a 30,400-dalton glycoprotein that regulates red cell production. In the human, EPO is produced by peritubular cells in the kidneys of the adult and in hepattocytes in the fetus. Small amounts of extra-renal EPO are produced by the liver in adult human subjects. EPO binds to an erythroid progenitor cell surface receptor that includes a p66 chain, and, when activated, the p66 protein becomes dimerized. EPO receptor activation induces a JAK2 tyrosine kinase, which leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the EPO receptor and several proteins. EPO receptor binding leads to intracellular activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated kinase pathway, which is involved with cell proliferation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and STATS 1, 3, 5A, and 5B transcriptional factors. EPO acts primarily to rescue erythrold cells from apoptosis (programmed cell death) to increase their survival. EPO acts synergistically with several growth factors (SCIF, GM-CSF, 1L-3, and IGF-1) to cause maturation and proliferation of erythrold progenitor cells (primarily colony-forming unit-E). Oxygen-dependent regulation of EPO gene expression is postulated to be controlled by a hypoxia-Inducible transcription factor (HIF-1alpha). Hypoxia-inducible EPO production is controlled by a 50-bp hypoxia-inducible enhancer that is approximately 120 bp 3' to the polyadenylation site. Hypoxia signal transduction pathways involve kinases A and C, phospholipase A(2), and transcription factors ATF-1 and CREB-1. A model has been proposed for adenosine activation of EPO production that involves protein kinases A and C and the phospholipase A(2) pathway. Other effects of EPO include a hematocrit-independent, vasoconstriction-dependent hypertension, increased endothelin production, upregulation of tissue renin, change in vascular tissue prostaglandins production, stimulation of angiogenesis, and stimulation of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) is currently being used to treat patients with anemias associated with chronic renal failure, AIDS patients with anemia due to treatment with zidovudine, nonmyeloid malignancies in patients treated with chemotherapeutic agents, perioperative surgical patients, and autologous blood donation. A novel erythropoiesis-stimulating factor (NESP, darbepoetin) has been synthesized and when compared with rHuEPO, NESP has a higher carbohydrate content (52% vs 40%), a longer plasma half-life, the amino acid sequence differs from that of native human EPO at five positions, and has been reported to maintain hemoglobin levels just as effectively in patients with chronic renal failure as rHuEPO at less frequent dosing. The use of rHuEPO and darbepoetin to enhance athletic performance is officially banned by most sports-governing bodies because the excessive erythrocytosis can lead to increased thrombogenicity and can cause deep vein, coronary, and cerebral thromboses.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1535-3702",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2003,"228","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000180294400001",12524467,558,"558 no 1"

We have further defined the roles of key features of yeast U6 snRNA in the splicing process. By assaying spliceosome assembly and splicing in yeast extracts, we found that mutations of yeast U6 nt 56 and 57 are similar to previously reported deletions of U2 nt 27 or 28, all within yeast U2-U6 helix I-a. These mutations lead to the accumulation of yeast A1 spliceosomes, which form just prior to the Prp2 ATPase step and the first chemical step of splicing. These results strongly suggest that, at a late stage of spliceosome assembly, the presence of U2-U6 helix la is important for promoting the first chemical step of splicing, presumably by bringing together the 5' splice site region of pre-mRNA, which is base paired to U6 snRNA, and the branchsite region of the intron, which is base paired to U2 snRNA, for activation of the first chemical step of splicing, as previously proposed by Madhani and Guthrie [Cell, 1992, 71: 803-817]. In the 3' intramolecular stem-loop of U6, mutation G81C causes an allele-specific accumulation of U6 snRNP.

Defects in primary cilia underlie a class of human diseases collectively termed ciliopathies. Primary cilia are restricted subcellular compartments, and specialized mechanisms coordinate the localization of proteins to cilia. Moreover, trafficking of proteins into and out of cilia is required for proper ciliary function, and this process is disrupted in ciliopathies. The somatostatin receptor subtype 3 (Sstr3) is selectively targeted to primary cilia on neurons in the mammalian brain and is implicated in learning and memory. Here, we show that Sstr3 localization to cilia is dynamic and decreases in response to somatostatin treatment. We further show that somatostatin treatment stimulates beta-arrestin recruitment into Sstr3-positive cilia and this recruitment can be blocked by mutations in Sstr3 that impact agonist binding or phosphorylation. Importantly, somatostatin treatment fails to decrease Sstr3 ciliary localization in neurons lacking beta-arrestin 2.

While it is known that a loss of any single subunit prevents ciliary trafficking of the BBSome and its cargos, the mechanisms underlying ciliary entry of this complex are not well characterized. Here, we report that a transition zone protein NPHP5 contains two separate BBS-binding sites and interacts with the BBSome to mediate its integrity. Depletion of NPHP5, or expression of NPHP5 mutant missing one binding site, specifically leads to dissociation of BBS2 and BBS5 from the BBSome and loss of ciliary BBS2 and BBS5 without compromising the ability of the other subunits to traffic into cilia. Depletion of Cep290, another transition zone protein that directly binds to NPHP5, causes additional dissociation of BBS8 and loss of ciliary BBS8. Furthermore, delivery of BBSome cargos, smoothened, VPAC2 and Rab8a, to the ciliary compartment is completely disabled in the absence of single BBS subunits, but is selectively impaired in the absence of NPHP5 or Cep290.

In the absence of Shh, the bifunctional Gli transcription factors are proteolytically processed into repressor forms in a protein kinase A (PKA)- and cilium-dependent manner.

Most mutants that cause disruption of the cilium result in decreased Shh signaling in the neural tube. In contrast, mutations in the intraflagellar complex A (IFT-A) and the tubby family protein, Tulp3, result in increased Shh signaling in the neural tube. Proteomic analysis of Tulp3-binding proteins first pointed to the role of the IFT-A complex in trafficking Tulp3 into the cilia. Tulp3 directs trafficking of rhodopsin family G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cilia, suggesting the role of a GPCR in mediating the paradoxical effects of the Tulp3/IFT-A complex in causing increased Shh signaling. Gpr161 has recently been identified as a Tulp3/IFTA-regulated GPCR that localizes to the primary cilium. A null knock-out mouse model of Gpr161 phenocopies Tulp3 and IFT-A mutants, and causes increased Shh signaling throughout the neural tube. In the absence of Shh, the bifunctional Gli transcription factors are proteolytically processed into repressor forms in a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent and cilium-dependent manner. Gpr161 activity results in increased cAMP levels in a G alpha(s)-coupled manner, and determines processing of Gli3. Shh signaling also results in removal of Gpr161 from the cilia, suggesting that Gpr161 functions in a positive feedback loop in the Shh pathway. As PKA-null and G alpha(s) mutant embryos also exhibit increased Shh signaling in the neural tube, Gpr161 is a strong candidate for a GPCR that regulates ciliary cAMP levels, and activates PKA in close proximity to the cilia.

A recent chemical screening study demonstrated that many compounds targeting dopamine receptors regulate the assembly of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagella, structures which are analogous to vertebrate cilia. Here we investigated the effects of dopaminergic inputs loss on the architecture of neuronal primary cilia in the rodent striatum, a brain region that receives major dopaminergic projections from the midbrain. We first analyzed the lengths of neuronal cilia in the dorsolateral striatum of hemi-parkinsonian rats with unilateral lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway. In these rats, the striatal neuronal cilia were significantly longer on the lesioned side than on the non-lesioned side. In mice, the repeated injection of reserpine, a dopamine-depleting agent, elongated neuronal cilia in the striatum. The combined administration of agonists for dopamine receptor type 2 (D2) with reserpine attenuated the elongation of striatal neuronal cilia. Repeated treatment with an antagonist of D2, but not of dopamine receptor type 1 (D1), elongated the striatal neuronal cilia. In addition, D2-null mice displayed longer neuronal cilia in the striatum compared to wild-type controls. Reserpine treatment elongated the striatal neuronal cilia in D1-null mice but not in D2-null mice. Repeated treatment with a D2 agonist suppressed the elongation of striatal neuronal cilia on the lesioned side of hemi-parkinsonian rats.

VPAC2 is released into the extracellular milieu in the form of ciliary ectosomes that are devoid of exosome markers. The agonist-induced VPAC2 shedding is selective, as shown by the fact that other ciliary membrane proteins including two ciliary GPCRs are not shed with VPAC2. VPAC2 ectosome shedding is dependent on several components of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), including a subset of ESCRT-III, VPS4, and LIP5. Agonist-stimulated VPAC2 is important for ciliary-ectosome generation because it allows VPS4 and LIP5 to transiently accumulate in primary cilia.

A previous study by our laboratory identified that knockdown of Beclin 1 promoted cell growth and inhibited apoptosis in the A549 lung cancer cell line. In the present study, a Beclin 1 lentiviral expression vector was constructed, and an A549 cell line was established with a steady expression of Beclin 1. Furthermore, the effect of Beclin 1 overexpression on cell invasion and apoptosis, changes in the activities of the apoptosis-associated caspases-3 and -9, and the overexpression of esophageal cancer-related gene 4 (ECRG4) were examined. The results demonstrated that the overexpression of Beclin 1 in A549 cells reduced cell invasion by Matrigel invasion assay and promoted apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis (P<0.01) compared with Lenex-packaged lentiviral particles and non-transfected control groups. Furthermore, the overexpression of Beclin 1 in A549 cells increased the activities of caspases-3 and -9 and the expression of ECRG4 (P<0.01) compared with Lenex-packaged lentiviral particles and non-transfected control groups. In conclusion, the overexpression of Beclin 1 promoted apoptosis and decreased invasion by upregulating the expression of ECRG4 in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Therefore, the selection of Beclin 1 as a target for gene therapy represents a more effective method for the treatment of lung cancer.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1791-2997","1791-3004",NA,NA,NA,"JUL",2016,"14","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"355","360",NA,"10.3892/mmr.2016.5219",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000379551700045",27175789,2927,"2927 no 1"
